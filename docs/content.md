Given that the host-microbe interaction is shaped by the immune system response, it is important to understand the key immune system-microbiota relationship during the period from conception to the first years of life. The present work summarizes the available evidence concerning human reproductive microbiota, and also, the microbial colonization during early life, focusing on the potential impact on infant development and health outcomes. Furthermore, we conclude that some dietary strategies including specific probiotics and other-biotics could become potentially valuable tools to modulate the maternal-neonatal microbiota during this early critical window of opportunity for targeted health outcomes throughout the entire lifespan.

The human gut flora comprises a dynamic network of bacterial species that coexist in a finely tuned equilibrium. The interaction with intestinal bacteria profoundly influences the host's development, metabolism, immunity, and overall health. Furthermore, dysbiosis, a disruption of the gut microbiota, can induce a variety of diseases, not exclusively associated with the intestinal tract. The increased consumption of animal protein, high-fat and high-sugar diets in Western countries has been implicated in the rise of chronic and inflammatory illnesses associated with dysbiosis. In particular, this diet leads to the overgrowth of sulfide-producing bacteria, known as sulfidogenic bacteria, which has been linked to inflammatory bowel diseases and colorectal cancer, among other disorders. Sulfidogenic bacteria include sulfate-reducing bacteria (Desulfovibrio spp.) and Bilophila wadsworthia among others, which convert organic and inorganic sulfur compounds to sulfide through the dissimilatory sulfite reduction pathway. At high concentrations, sulfide is cytotoxic and disrupts the integrity of the intestinal epithelium and mucus barrier, triggering inflammation. Besides producing sulfide, B. wadsworthia has revealed significant pathogenic potential, demonstrated in the ability to cause infection, adhere to intestinal cells, promote inflammation, and compromise the integrity of the colonic mucus layer. This review delves into the mechanisms by which taurine and sulfide-driven gut dysbiosis contribute to the pathogenesis of sulfidogenic bacteria, and discusses the role of these gut microbes, particularly B. wadsworthia, in human diseases.

## Target-Driven Tissue-Agnostic Drug Approvals-A New Path of Drug Development.
 29.07.2024, _KZ Thein, YM Myat, BS Park, K Panigrahi, S Kummar_


The regulatory approvals of tumor-agnostic therapies have led to the re-evaluation of the drug development process. The conventional models of drug development are histology-based. On the other hand, the tumor-agnostic drug development of a new drug (or combination) focuses on targeting a common genomic biomarker in multiple cancers, regardless of histology. The basket-like clinical trials with multiple cohorts allow clinicians to evaluate pan-cancer efficacy and toxicity. There are currently eight tumor agnostic approvals granted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This includes two immune checkpoint inhibitors, and five targeted therapy agents. Pembrolizumab is an anti-programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) antibody that was the first FDA-approved tumor-agnostic treatment for unresectable or metastatic microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) solid tumors in 2017. It was later approved for tumor mutational burden-high (TMB-H) solid tumors, although the TMB cut-off used is still debated. Subsequently, in 2021, another anti-PD-1 antibody, dostarlimab, was also approved for dMMR solid tumors in the refractory setting. Patients with fusion-positive cancers are typically difficult to treat due to their rare prevalence and distribution. Gene rearrangements or fusions are present in a variety of tumors. Neurotrophic tyrosine kinase (NTRK) fusions are present in a range of pediatric and adult solid tumors in varying frequency. Larotrectinib and entrectinib were approved for neurotrophic tyrosine kinase (NTRK) fusion-positive cancers. Similarly, selpercatinib was approved for rearranged during transfection (RET) fusion-positive solid tumors. The FDA approved the first combination therapy of dabrafenib, a B-Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) inhibitor, plus trametinib, a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor for patients 6 months or older with unresectable or metastatic tumors (except colorectal cancer) carrying a BRAFV600E mutation. The most recent FDA tumor-agnostic approval is of fam-trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki (T-Dxd) for HER2-positive solid tumors. It is important to identify and expeditiously develop drugs that have the potential to provide clinical benefit across tumor types.

Our understanding of particular gut microbiota members such as Bifidobacterium and Enterococcus in low-middle-income countries remains very limited, particularly early life strain-level beneficial traits. This study addresses this gap by exploring a collection of bacterial strains isolated from the gut of Zimbabwean infants; comparing their genomic characteristics with strains isolated from infants across North America, Europe, and other regions of Africa.

## Gut microbial features and circulating metabolomic signatures of frailty in older adults.
 25.07.2024, _Y Pu, Z Sun, H Zhang, Q Huang, Z Wang, Z Mei, P Wang, M Kong, W Yang, C Lin, X Zhou, S Lin, Q Huang, L Huang, L Sun, C Yuan, Q Xu, H Tang, X Wang, Y Zheng_


Frailty, a multidimensional indicator of suboptimal aging, reflects cumulative declines across multiple physiological systems. Although age-related changes have been reported in gut microbiota, their role in healthy aging remains unclear. In this study, we calculated frailty index (FI) from 33 health-related items to reflect the overall health status of 1,821 older adults (62-96 years, 55% female) and conducted multi-omics analysis using gut metagenomic sequencing data and plasma metabolomic data. We identified 18 microbial species and 17 metabolites shifted along with frailty severity, with stronger links observed in females. The associations of nine species, including various Clostridium species and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, with FI were reproducible in two external populations. Plasma glycerol levels, white blood cell count and kidney function partially mediated these associations. A composite microbial score derived from FI significantly predicted 2-year mortality (adjusted hazard ratio across extreme quartiles, 2.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.38-5.93), highlighting the potential of microbiota-based strategies for risk stratification in older adults.

## Detection of Microplastics in Human Breast Milk and Its Association with Changes in Human Milk Bacterial Microbiota.
 29.07.2024, _A Saraluck, T Techarang, P Bunyapipat, K Boonchuwong, Y Pullaput, A Mordmuang_


Background: Presently, there is increasing public consciousness regarding the contamination and detection of microplastics (MPs) within the human body, and studies on the detection and characterization of MPs in human breast milk are limited. Objectives: This study aims to investigate the prevalence and characteristics of MPs found in human breast milk and examine the relationship between maternal hygiene practices, complications that may arise during breastfeeding, and the composition of the bacterial microbiota. Methods: Postpartum breast milk was analyzed for MPs using Raman micro-spectroscopy. The relationship between MP detection, maternal hygiene, breastfeeding complications, and bacterial microbiota was examined. In order to identify correlations and differences between groups that had detected and non-detected MPs, statistical analyses were performed, which involved demographic comparisons and correlation network analysis. Results: The mean age of the 59 postpartum women was 28.13 years. We found MPs in 38.98% of breast milk samples (23 of 59), exhibiting diverse morphological and chemical characteristics. Most MP polymers were polypropylene, polyethylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride. Maternal hygiene and breastfeeding complications differed between the MPs-detected and non-detected groups. Maternal behaviors may influence the presence of microplastics in breast milk, which were associated with these differences. Bacterial microbiota analysis revealed significant taxonomic differences between the MPs-detected and non-detected groups. Staphylococcus and Streptococcus dominated the MPs-detected group, while Enterobacter, Escherichia, Pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter dominated the non-detected group. The MPs-detected group had a more even bacterial distribution, especially Bacteroides. Conclusions: This study found MPs in 38.98% of breast milk samples using Raman micro-spectrometry, with PP, PE, and PVC being the most common. Significant differences in maternal hygiene and breastfeeding complications were found between the groups with and without MPs. Breast milk microbiota may be linked to MP detection. Further study should be conducted to identify the possible maternal-child health.

## Regional Differences in Microbial Infiltration of Brain Tissue from Alzheimer's Disease Patients and Control Individuals.
 29.07.2024, _TB Jones, P Chu, B Wilkey, L Lynch, G Jentarra_


Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by cognitive decline and neuropathology including amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (tau). Factors initiating or driving these pathologies remain unclear, though microbes have been increasingly implicated. Our data and others' findings indicate that microbes may be common constituents of the brain. It is notable that Aβ and tau have antimicrobial properties, suggesting a response to microbes in the brain. We used 16S rRNA sequencing to compare major bacterial phyla in post-mortem tissues from individuals exhibiting a range of neuropathology and cognitive status in two brain regions variably affected in AD. Our data indicate that strong regional differences exist, driven in part by the varied presence of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. We confirmed our data using ELISA of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoteichoic acid in the same brain tissue. We identified a potential association between the composition of phyla and the presence of neuropathology but not cognitive status. Declining cognition and increasing pathology correlated closely with serum LPS, but not brain levels of LPS, although brain LPS showed a strong negative correlation with cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Collectively, our data suggest a region-specific heterogeneity of microbial populations in brain tissue potentially associated with neurodegenerative pathology.

## Digesting the complex metabolic effects of diet on the host and microbiome.
 27.07.2024, _RN Carmody, K Varady, PJ Turnbaugh_


_Humans, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Diet, Animals, Obesity, Energy Metabolism_
The past 50 years of interdisciplinary research in humans and model organisms has delivered unprecedented insights into the mechanisms through which diet affects energy balance. However, translating these results to prevent and treat obesity and its associated diseases remains challenging. Given the vast scope of this literature, we focus this Review on recent conceptual advances in molecular nutrition targeting the management of energy balance, including emerging dietary and pharmaceutical interventions and their interactions with the human gut microbiome. Notably, multiple current dietary patterns of interest embrace moderate-to-high fat intake or prioritize the timing of eating over macronutrient intake. Furthermore, the rapid expansion of microbiome research findings has complicated multiple longstanding tenets of nutrition while also providing new opportunities for intervention. Continued progress promises more precise and reliable dietary recommendations that leverage our growing knowledge of the microbiome, the changing landscape of clinical interventions, and our molecular understanding of human biology.

## A comprehensive review of synbiotics: an emerging paradigm in health promotion and disease management.
 27.07.2024, _S Lee, SP Choi, HJ Choi, H Jeong, YS Park_


_Synbiotics, Humans, Prebiotics, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Probiotics, Health Promotion, Disease Management, Oligosaccharides, Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Obesity, Gastrointestinal Diseases_
Synbiotics are complex preparations of prebiotics that can be selectively utilized by live microorganisms to improve host health. Synbiotics are divided into complementary synbiotics, which consist of probiotics and prebiotics with independent functions, and synergistic synbiotics, which consist of prebiotics that are selectively used by gut microorganisms. Complementary synbiotics used in human clinical trials include Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. as probiotics, and fructooligosaccharides, galactooligosaccharides, and inulin as prebiotics. Over the past five years, synbiotics have been most commonly used in patients with metabolic disorders, including obesity, and immune and gastrointestinal disorders. Several studies have observed alterations in the microbial community; however, these changes did not lead to significant improvements in disease outcomes or biochemical and hematological markers. The same synbiotics have been applied to individuals with different gut environments. As a result, even with the same synbiotics, there are non-responders who do not respond to the applied synbiotics due to the different intestinal environment for each individual. Therefore, to obtain meaningful results, applying different synbiotics depending on the individual is necessary. Synergistic synbiotics are one solution to circumvent this problem, as they combine elements that can effectively improve health, even in non-responders. This review aims to explain the concept of synbiotics, highlight recent human clinical trials, and explore the current state of research on synergistic synbiotics.

## Soil conditions modify species diversity effects on tree functional trait expression.
 28.07.2024, _A Davrinche, S Haider_


_Soil, Biodiversity, Trees, Soil Microbiology, Plant Leaves, Ecosystem, Phosphorus_
Examples of positive effects of biodiversity on ecosystem functions have kept accumulating in the last two decades, and functional traits are considered suitable tools to explain their underlying mechanisms. However, traits are rarely studied at the scale where these mechanisms (e.g., complementarity) are likely to originate, that is, between two interacting individuals. In an 18-month greenhouse experiment, we investigated how species diversity (i.e., monospecific or heterospecific tree pairs) affects within-individual leaf traits expression and variation and how this effect is modified by soil conditions. While resource addition through phosphorus fertilization partly strengthened the diversity effects, inoculation of soil microbiota (potentially leading to increased resource accessibility) resulted in counter effects. Hence, in contrast to our expectations, we did not find synergistic effects of the two soil treatments, but we found distinct effects on species following an acquisitive or conservative growth strategy. Overall, our study showed that the effect of species diversity on young trees' adaptability and resource-use strategy needs to be considered alongside soil biotic and abiotic aspects. The influence of soil conditions on species diversity effects is essential to understand mechanisms behind complementarity at the individual level, which ultimately translate to the community scale.

## Compositional Data and Microbiota Analysis: Imagination and Reality.
 29.07.2024, _T Itagaki, H Kobayashi, KI Sakata, I Miyamoto, A Hasebe, Y Kitagawa_


The relationships among bacterial flora, diseases, and diet have been described by many authors. An operational taxonomic units (OTUs) are the result of clustering the 16S rRNA gene sequences at a certain cutoff value, and they are considered compositional data. As Pearson's correlation coefficient is difficult to interpret, Aitchison's ratio analysis was used to develop a method to handle compositional data. Multivariate analysis was developed because univariate analysis can be subject to large biases. Simulations regarding absolute abundance based on certain assumptions and some analyses, such as nonparametric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), principal component analysis (PCA), and ratio analysis, were conducted in this study. The same content as a 100% stacked bar graph could be expressed in low dimensions using PCA. However, the relative diversity was not reproducible with NMDS. Various assumptions were made regarding absolute abundance based on the relative abundance. However, which assumptions are true could not be determined. In summary, ratio analysis and PCA are useful for analyzing compositional data and the gut microbiota.
