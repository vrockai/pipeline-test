## The dark matter of microbiome: the mother-infant pair virome.
 27.10.2020, _F Comitini, V Fanos_


The human virome belongs to one of the most complex ecosystems in the world, the microbiome. The virome that inhabits the intestinal niche and its dynamic variation during the first year of life had been the most investigated. Many pathogenic viruses are well known to be potentially transmitted transplacentally or during vaginal delivery to the newborn, but recent studies on healthy term pregnancies found that there was no evidence of a principal viral community. In the maternalfetal dyad, human milk has been demonstrated to be one of the earliest factors involved in the direct virome transmission. Despite the relationship between humans and viruses traces its roots back to ancient times, the mother-infant pair virome has been poorly investigated and represents currently a "dark matter" of the microbiome.

## Intrauterine Growth Restriction Is Associated with Unique Features of the Reproductive Microbiome.
 27.10.2020, _J Hu, P Benny, M Wang, Y Ma, L Lambertini, I Peter, Y Xu, MJ Lee_


Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is an obstetrical complication with an increased risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity. The uterus, once considered to be a sterile environment, has now been described in recent microbiome studies to harbor diverse commensal placenta microbiota, as well as potentially pathogenic flora known to cause infection. Therefore, in this pilot study, we tested whether IUGR was associated with changes to the reproductive microbiome. The reproductive microbiome was surveyed using 16S sequencing (20 IUGR, 20 controls). Alpha and beta diversity were compared, and differential taxa features associated with IUGR were identified. Microbial screening of the placenta demonstrated a diverse range of flora predominantly including Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes. Neither alpha- nor beta-diversity was significantly different by IUGR status. However, at the taxa level, IUGR patients had significantly higher prevalence of Neisseriaceae, mucosal β-hemolytic bacteria known to uptake iron-bound host proteins including hemoglobin. Moreover, the increase in anaerobic bacteria such as Desulfovibrio reflects the emergence of a hypoxic environment in the IUGR placenta. Further analysis of the reproductive microbiome of IUGR samples showed lower levels of H202-producing Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus that switch from respiration to fermentation, a less energetic metabolic process, when oxygen levels decrease. Source tracking analysis showed that the placental microbial contents were predominantly contributed from an oral source, as compared to a gut or vaginal source. Our results suggest that the reproductive microbiome profiles may, in the future, constitute potential biomarkers for fetal health during pregnancy, while Neisseriaceae may constitute promising therapeutic targets for IUGR treatment.

## Circadian rhythms and the gut microbiota: from the metabolic syndrome to cancer.
 27.10.2020, _F Bishehsari, RM Voigt, A Keshavarzian_


The metabolic syndrome is prevalent in developed nations and accounts for the largest burden of non-communicable diseases worldwide. The metabolic syndrome has direct effects on health and increases the risk of developing cancer. Lifestyle factors that are known to promote the metabolic syndrome generally cause pro-inflammatory alterations in microbiota communities in the intestine. Indeed, alterations to the structure and function of intestinal microbiota are sufficient to promote the metabolic syndrome, inflammation and cancer. Among the lifestyle factors that are associated with the metabolic syndrome, disruption of the circadian system, known as circadian dysrhythmia, is increasingly common. Disruption of the circadian system can alter microbiome communities and can perturb host metabolism, energy homeostasis and inflammatory pathways, which leads to the metabolic syndrome. This Perspective discusses the role of intestinal microbiota and microbial metabolites in mediating the effects of disruption of circadian rhythms on human health.

## Ecological Structuring of Temperate Bacteriophages in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease-Affected Gut.
 30.10.2020, _H Nishiyama, H Endo, R Blanc-Mathieu, H Ogata_


The aim of this study was to elucidate the ecological structure of the human gut temperate bacteriophage community and its role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Temperate bacteriophages make up a large proportion of the human gut microbiota and are likely to play a role in IBD pathogenesis. However, many of these bacteriophages await characterization in reference databases. Therefore, we conducted a large-scale reconstruction of temperate bacteriophage and bacterial genomes from the whole-metagenome sequence data generated by the IBD Multi'omics Database project. By associating phages with their hosts via genome comparisons, we found that temperate bacteriophages infect a phylogenetically wide range of bacteria. The majority of variance in bacteriophage community composition was explained by variation among individuals, but differences in the abundance of temperate bacteriophages were identified between IBD and non-IBD patients. Of note, in active ulcerative colitis patients, temperate bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides uniformis and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron-two species experimentally proven to be beneficial to gut homeostasis-were over-represented, whereas their hosts were under-represented in comparison with non-IBD patients. Supporting the mounting evidence that gut viral community plays a vital role in IBD, our results show potential association between temperate bacteriophages and IBD pathogenesis.

## Host population size is linked to orchid mycorrhizal fungal communities in roots and soil, which are shaped by microenvironment.
 28.10.2020, _J Kaur, C Phillips, J Sharma_


Interaction with orchid mycorrhizal fungi (OMF) is essential to all members of the Orchidaceae, yet we know little about whether or how OMF abundances in substrates shape orchid populations. While root-associated OMF diversity is catalogued frequently, technological constraints have impeded the assessments of OMF communities in substrates until recently, thereby limiting the ability to link OMF communities in a habitat to population responses. Furthermore, there is some evidence that edaphic and microclimatic conditions impact OMF in soil, yet we lack an understanding of the coupled influences of abiotic environment and OMF structure on orchid population dynamics. To discover the linkages between abiotic environment, OMF community structure, and population size, we characterized the microclimatic conditions, soil physicochemistry, and OMF communities hosted by roots and soil across large and small populations of a terrestrial orchid endemic to California Floristic Province in North America. By using high-throughput sequencing of the ITS2 region of nrDNA amplified from root and soil DNAs, we determined that both roots and soil of larger populations, which were high in phosphorus but low in zinc, organic matter, and silt, were dominated by Tulasnellaceae OTUs. In comparison, roots and soil from smaller populations of the orchid hosted higher relative abundances of the Ceratobasidiaceae. In this multiyear, range-wide study that simultaneously measured habitat environmental conditions, and soil and root OMF communities, our results suggest that soil chemistry is clearly linked to soil and root OMF communities, which then likely alter and shape orchid populations.

## Root exudates drive soil-microbe-nutrient feedbacks in response to plant growth.
 26.10.2020, _M Zhao, J Zhao, J Yuan, L Hale, T Wen, Q Huang, JM Vivanco, J Zhou, GA Kowalchuk, Q Shen_


Although interactions between plants and microbes at the plant-soil interface are known to be important for plant nutrient acquisition, relatively little is known about how root exudates contribute to nutrient exchange over the course of plant development. In this study, root exudates from slow- and fast-growing stages of Arabidopsis thaliana plants were collected, chemically analyzed and then applied to a sandy nutrient-depleted soil. We then tracked the impacts of these exudates on soil bacterial communities, soil nutrients (ammonium, nitrate, available phosphorus and potassium) and plant growth. Both pools of exudates shifted bacterial community structure. GeoChip analyses revealed increases in the functional gene potential of both exudate-treated soils, with similar responses observed for slow-growing and fast-growing plant exudate treatments. The fast-growing stage root exudates induced higher nutrient mineralization and enhanced plant growth as compared to treatments with slow-growing stage exudates and the control. These results suggest that plants may adjust their exudation patterns over the course their different growth phases to help tailor microbial recruitment to meet increased nutrient demands during periods demanding faster growth.

## Diversity and Dynamics of Seaweed Associated Microbial Communities Inhabiting the Lagoon of Venice.
 29.10.2020, _AS Juhmani, A Vezzi, M Wahsha, A Buosi, F Pascale, R Schiavon, A Sfriso_


Seaweeds are a group of essential photosynthetic organisms that harbor a rich diversity of associated microbial communities with substantial functions related to host health and defense. Environmental and anthropogenic stressors may disrupt the microbial communities and their metabolic activity, leading to host physiological alterations that negatively affect seaweeds' performance and survival. Here, the bacterial communities associated with one of the most common seaweed, Ulva laetevirens Areshough, were sampled over a year at three sites of the lagoon of Venice affected by different environmental and anthropogenic stressors. Bacterial communities were characterized through Illumina sequencing of the V4 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA genes. The study demonstrated that the seaweed associated bacterial communities at sites impacted by environmental stressors were host-specific and differed significantly from the less affected site. Furthermore, these communities were significantly distinct from those of the surrounding seawater. The bacterial communities' composition was significantly correlated with environmental parameters (nutrient concentrations, dissolved oxygen saturation, and pH) across sites. This study showed that several more abundant bacteria on U. laetevirens at stressed sites belonged to taxa related to the host response to the stressors. Overall, environmental parameters and anthropogenic stressors were shown to substantially affect seaweed associated bacterial communities, which reflect the host response to environmental variations.
