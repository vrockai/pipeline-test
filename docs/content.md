## Differences in the individual curative effect of acupuncture for obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome based on metagenomic analysis: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
 16.07.2021, _H Fan, X Hong, J Zeng, X Wang, J Chen_


Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common cause of infertility and shows a high incidence in women of reproductive age. Acupuncture is an appropriate adjunctive treatment for PCOS. However, the add-on effect of acupuncture as an adjunctive treatment for obese women with PCOS has not been studied, and previous studies indicate that there are individual differences in the curative effect of acupuncture, while deeper research on the mechanism of differences in the individual curative effect of acupuncture for obese women with PCOS is still lacking. This trial aims to assess the add-on treatment efficacy of acupuncture for obese women with PCOS and to explore the role of the gut microbiome on the differences in the individual curative effect of acupuncture based on metagenomic analysis.

## A sociological autopsy lens on older adult suicide in rural Australia: Addressing health, psychosocial factors and care practices at the intersection of policies and institutions.
 16.07.2021, _SJ Fitzpatrick, D Read, BK Brew, D Perkins_


This paper examines the interrelationship between suicide, health, socioeconomic, and psychosocial factors in contributing to suicide in older adults in rural Australia. Drawing on a coronial dataset of suicide cases and a mixed methods sociological autopsy approach, our study integrated a quantitative analysis of 792 suicide cases with a qualitative analysis of medico-legal reports from 30 cases. The sociological autopsy provided novel insights into the entanglement of policy and service provision at the state-level with individual end-of-life decisions. Particular attention is drawn to age and gendered dimensions of suicide, especially in relation to health and social issues. The study showed a continuity between suicide and the patterning of an individual's life course, including experiences and consequences of inequality and marginality; a desire to meet culturally-normative ideals of autonomy; and a fragmented, under-funded, and intimidating social care system that offered limited options.

## Investigating components of pranayama for effects on heart rate variability.
 16.07.2021, _E Sharpe, A Lacombe, A Sadowski, J Phipps, R Heer, S Rajurkar, D Hanes, RD Jindal, R Bradley_


Traditional Indian breath control practices of Pranayama have been shown to increase indices of heart rate variability (HRV) that are generally held to reflect parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) tone. To our knowledge, individual components of pranayama have not been separately evaluated for impact on HRV. The objective of this study was to isolate five components of a pranayama practice and evaluate their impact on HRV.

## Altering the gut microbiome to potentially modulate behavioral manifestations in autism spectrum disorders: A systematic review.
 17.07.2021, _C Davies, D Mishra, RS Eshraghi, J Mittal, R Sinha, E Bulut, R Mittal, AA Eshraghi_


There is a potential association between gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and the severity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Given this correlation, the possible impact of probiotics and prebiotics have been explored in research studies to modify the gut microbiome and ameliorate behavioral manifestations of ASD via modulating the gut-brain-microbiome axis. This systematic review focuses on the interplay between these factors in altering the behavioral manifestations of ASD. Probiotic supplementation tended to mitigate some of the behavioral manifestations of ASD, with less of a discernible trend on the microbiome level. Studies supplementing multiple probiotic species, such as microbiota transfer therapy, or including prebiotics performed better than single strain supplementation. Our analysis suggests that gut dysbiosis may increase intestinal permeability, leading to more severe GI symptoms and a systemic inflammatory response, which can alter permeability across the blood-brain barrier and synaptogenesis in the brain. Future studies are warranted to understand the precise contribution of altering gut microbiome on clinical manifestations of ASD that will open up avenues to develop preventive and treatment modalities.

## Rapid spread of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant in some French regions, June 2021.
 16.07.2021, _S Alizon, S Haim-Boukobza, V Foulongne, L Verdurme, S Trombert-Paolantoni, E Lecorche, B Roquebert, MT Sofonea_


We analysed 9,030 variant-specific RT-PCR tests performed on SARS-CoV-2-positive samples collected in France between 31 May and 21 June 2021. This analysis revealed rapid growth of the Delta variant in three of the 13 metropolitan French regions and estimated a +79% (95% confidence interval: 52-110%) transmission advantage compared with the Alpha variant. The next weeks will prove decisive and the magnitude of the estimated transmission advantages of the Delta variant could represent a major challenge for public health authorities.

## Identification of pathogen(s) in infectious diseases using shotgun metagenomic sequencing and conventional culture: a comparative study.
 13.07.2021, _H Chen, J Li, S Yan, H Sun, C Tan, M Liu, K Liu, H Zhang, M Zou, X Xiao_


Early and accurate diagnosis of microorganism(s) is important to optimize antimicrobial therapy. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing technology, an unbiased and comprehensive method for pathogen identification, seems to potentially assist or even replace conventional microbiological methodology in the diagnosis of infectious diseases. However, evidence in clinical application of this platform is relatively limited.

## Predicting antibiotic resistance gene abundance in activated sludge using shotgun metagenomics and machine learning.
 15.07.2021, _Y Sun, B Clarke, J Clarke, X Li_


While the microbiome of activated sludge (AS) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) plays a vital role in shaping the resistome, identifying the potential bacterial hosts of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in WWTPs remains challenging. The objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of using a machine learning approach, random forests (RF's), to identify the strength of associations between ARGs and bacterial taxa in metagenomic datasets from the activated sludge of WWTPs. Our results show that the abundance of select ARGs can be predicted by RF's using abundant genera (Candidatus Accumulibacter, Dechloromonas, Pesudomonas, and Thauera, etc.), (opportunistic) pathogens and indicators (Bacteroides, Clostridium, and Streptococcus, etc.), and nitrifiers (Nitrosomonas and Nitrospira, etc.) as explanatory variables. The correlations between predicted and observed abundance of ARGs (erm(B), tet(O), tet(Q), etc.) ranged from medium (0.400 &lt; R2 &lt; 0.600) to strong (R2 &gt; 0.600) when validated on testing datasets. Compared to those belonging to the other two groups, individual genera in the group of (opportunistic) pathogens and indicator bacteria had more positive functional relationships with select ARGs, suggesting genera in this group (e.g., Bacteroides, Clostridium, and Streptococcus) may be hosts of select ARGs. Furthermore, RF's with (opportunistic) pathogens and indicators as explanatory variables were used to predict the abundance of select ARGs in a full-scale WWTP successfully. Machine learning approaches such as RF's can potentially identify bacterial hosts of ARGs and reveal possible functional relationships between the ARGs and microbial community in the AS of WWTPs.

Ruminants rely upon a complex community of microbes in their rumen to convert host-indigestible feed into nutrients. However, little is known about the association between the rumen microbiota and feed efficiency traits in Nellore (Bos indicus) cattle, a breed of major economic importance to the global beef market. Here, we compare the composition of the bacterial, archaeal and fungal communities in the rumen of Nellore steers with high and low feed efficiency (FE) phenotypes, as measured by residual feed intake (RFI).

Computational methods are key in microbiome research, and obtaining a quantitative and unbiased performance estimate is important for method developers and applied researchers. For meaningful comparisons between methods, to identify best practices and common use cases, and to reduce overhead in benchmarking, it is necessary to have standardized datasets, procedures and metrics for evaluation. In this tutorial, we describe emerging standards in computational meta-omics benchmarking derived and agreed upon by a larger community of researchers. Specifically, we outline recent efforts by the Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation (CAMI) initiative, which supplies method developers and applied researchers with exhaustive quantitative data about software performance in realistic scenarios and organizes community-driven benchmarking challenges. We explain the most relevant evaluation metrics for assessing metagenome assembly, binning and profiling results, and provide step-by-step instructions on how to generate them. The instructions use simulated mouse gut metagenome data released in preparation for the second round of CAMI challenges and showcase the use of a repository of tool results for CAMI datasets. This tutorial will serve as a reference for the community and facilitate informative and reproducible benchmarking in microbiome research.

The ocean microbiota modulates global biogeochemical cycles and changes in its configuration may have large-scale consequences. Yet, the underlying ecological mechanisms structuring it are unclear. Here, we investigate how fundamental ecological mechanisms (selection, dispersal and ecological drift) shape the smallest members of the tropical and subtropical surface-ocean microbiota: prokaryotes and minute eukaryotes (picoeukaryotes). Furthermore, we investigate the agents exerting abiotic selection on this assemblage as well as the spatial patterns emerging from the action of ecological mechanisms. To explore this, we analysed the composition of surface-ocean prokaryotic and picoeukaryotic communities using DNA-sequence data (16S- and 18S-rRNA genes) collected during the circumglobal expeditions Malaspina-2010 and TARA-Oceans.
