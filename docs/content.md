 16.09.2020, _VK Gupta, M Kim, U Bakshi, KY Cunningham, JM Davis, KN Lazaridis, H Nelson, N Chia, J Sung_


Providing insight into one's health status from a gut microbiome sample is an important clinical goal in current human microbiome research. Herein, we introduce the Gut Microbiome Health Index (GMHI), a biologically-interpretable mathematical formula for predicting the likelihood of disease independent of the clinical diagnosis. GMHI is formulated upon 50 microbial species associated with healthy gut ecosystems. These species are identified through a multi-study, integrative analysis on 4347 human stool metagenomes from 34 published studies across healthy and 12 different nonhealthy conditions, i.e., disease or abnormal bodyweight. When demonstrated on our population-scale meta-dataset, GMHI is the most robust and consistent predictor of disease presence (or absence) compared to α-diversity indices. Validation on 679 samples from 9 additional studies results in a balanced accuracy of 73.7% in distinguishing healthy from non-healthy groups. Our findings suggest that gut taxonomic signatures can predict health status, and highlight how data sharing efforts can provide broadly applicable discoveries.

Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of intracellular aggregates of misfolded alpha-synuclein along the cerebral axis. Several studies report the association between intestinal dysbiosis and Parkinson's disease, although a cause-effect relationship remains to be established. Herein, the gut microbiota composition of 64 Italian patients with Parkinson's disease and 51 controls was determined using a next-generation sequencing approach. A real metagenomics shape based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was also investigated. The most significant changes within the Parkinson's disease group highlighted a reduction in bacterial taxa, which are linked to anti-inflammatory/neuroprotective effects, particularly in the Lachnospiraceae family and key members, such as Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, and Blautia The direct evaluation of fecal metabolites revealed changes in several classes of metabolites. Changes were seen in lipids (linoleic acid, oleic acid, succinic acid, and sebacic acid), vitamins (pantothenic acid and nicotinic acid), amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, phenylalanine, glutamic acid, and pyroglutamic acid) and other organic compounds (cadaverine, ethanolamine, and hydroxy propionic acid). Most modified metabolites strongly correlated with the abundance of members belonging to the Lachnospiraceae family, suggesting that these gut bacteria correlate with altered metabolism rates in Parkinson's disease.IMPORTANCE To our knowledge, this is one of the few studies thus far that correlates the composition of the gut microbiota with the direct analysis of fecal metabolites in patients with Parkinson's disease. Overall, our data highlight microbiota modifications correlated with numerous fecal metabolites. This suggests that Parkinson's disease is associated with gut dysregulation that involves a synergistic relationship between gut microbes and several bacterial metabolites favoring altered homeostasis. Interestingly, a reduction of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria influenced the shape of the metabolomics profile, affecting several metabolites with potential protective effects in the Parkinson group. On the other hand, the extensive impact that intestinal dysbiosis has at the level of numerous metabolic pathways could encourage the identification of specific biomarkers for the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease, also in light of the effect that specific drugs have on the composition of the intestinal microbiota.

Different patterns of bacterial communities have been reported in the airways and gastrointestinal tract of asthmatics when compared to healthy controls. However, the blood microbiome of asthmatics is yet to be investigated. Therefore, we aimed to determine whether a distinct serum microbiome is observed in asthmatics by metagenomic analysis of serum extracellular vesicles (EVs). We obtained serum from 190 adults with asthma and 260 healthy controls, from which EVs were isolated and analyzed. The bacterial composition of asthmatics was significantly different from that of healthy controls. Chao 1 index was significantly higher in the asthma group, while Shannon and Simpson indices were higher in the control group. At the phylum level, Bacteroidetes was more abundant in asthmatics, while Actinobacter, Verrucomicrobia, and Cyanobacteria were more abundant in healthy controls. At the genus level, 24 bacterial genera showed differences in relative abundance between asthmatics and controls, with linear discriminant analysis scores greater than 3. Further, in a diagnostic model based on these differences, a high predictive value with a sensitivity of 0.92 and a specificity of 0.93 was observed. In conclusion, we demonstrated distinct blood microbiome in asthma indicating the role of microbiome as a potential diagnostic marker of asthma.

## Influence of host genetics in shaping the rumen bacterial community in beef cattle.
 16.09.2020, _W Abbas, JT Howard, HA Paz, KE Hales, JE Wells, LA Kuehn, GE Erickson, ML Spangler, SC Fernando_


In light of recent host-microbial association studies, a consensus is evolving that species composition of the gastrointestinal microbiota is a polygenic trait governed by interactions between host genetic factors and the environment. Here, we investigated the effect of host genetic factors in shaping the bacterial species composition in the rumen by performing a genome-wide association study. Using a common set of 61,974 single-nucleotide polymorphisms found in cattle genomes (n = 586) and corresponding rumen bacterial community composition, we identified operational taxonomic units (OTUs), Families and Phyla with high heritability. The top associations (1-Mb windows) were located on 7 chromosomes. These regions were associated with the rumen microbiota in multiple ways; some (chromosome 19; position 3.0-4.0 Mb) are associated with closely related taxa (Prevotellaceae, Paraprevotellaceae, and RF16), some (chromosome 27; position 3.0-4.0 Mb) are associated with distantly related taxa (Prevotellaceae, Fibrobacteraceae, RF16, RFP12, S24-7, Lentisphaerae, and Tenericutes) and others (chromosome 23; position 0.0-1.0) associated with both related and unrelated taxa. The annotated genes associated with identified genomic regions suggest the associations observed are directed toward selective absorption of volatile fatty acids from the rumen to increase energy availability to the host. This study demonstrates that host genetics affects rumen bacterial community composition.

## Diazotrophic bacteria from maize exhibit multifaceted plant growth promotion traits in multiple hosts.
 14.09.2020, _SM Higdon, T Pozzo, EJ Tibbett, C Chiu, R Jeannotte, BC Weimer, AB Bennett_


Sierra Mixe maize is a geographically remote landrace variety grown on nitrogen-deficient fields in Oaxaca, Mexico that meets its nutritional requirements without synthetic fertilizer by associating with free-living diazotrophs comprising the microbiota of its aerial root mucilage. We selected nearly 500 diazotrophic (N2-fixing) bacteria isolated from Sierra Mixe maize mucilage and sequenced their genomes. Comparative genomic analysis demonstrated that isolates represented diverse genera and composed three major diazotrophic groups based on nitrogen fixation gene content. In addition to nitrogen fixation, we examined deamination of 1-amino-1-cyclopropanecarboxylic acid, biosynthesis of indole-3-acetic acid, and phosphate solubilization as alternative mechanisms of direct plant growth promotion (PGP). Genome mining showed that isolates of all diazotrophic groups possessed marker genes for multiple mechanisms of direct plant growth promotion (PGP). Implementing in vitro assays corroborated isolate genotypes by measuring each isolate's potential to confer the targeted PGP traits and revealed phenotypic variation among isolates based on diazotrophic group assignment. Investigating the ability of mucilage diazotrophs to confer PGP by direct inoculation of clonally propagated potato plants in planta led to the identification of 16 bio-stimulant candidates. Conducting nitrogen-stress greenhouse experiments demonstrated that potato inoculation with a synthetic community of bio-stimulant candidates, as well as with its individual components, resulted in PGP phenotypes. We further demonstrated that one diazotrophic isolate conferred PGP to a conventional maize variety under nitrogen-stress in the greenhouse. These results indicate that, while many diazotrophic isolates from Sierra Mixe maize possessed genotypes and in vitro phenotypes for targeted PGP traits, a subset of these organisms promoted the growth of potato and conventional maize, potentially through the use of multiple promotion mechanisms.

## Pollution shapes the microbial communities in river water and sediments from the Olifants River catchment, South Africa.
 13.09.2020, _A Valverde, ED Cason, A Gómez-Arias, D Bozkale, D Govender, E Riddell, D Cowan_


Human activities such as agriculture and mining are leading causes of water pollution worldwide. Individual contaminants are known to negatively affect microbial communities. However, the effect of multifaceted pollution on these communities is less well understood. We investigated, using next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA genes, the effects of multisource (i.e., fertilizer industry and mining) chronic pollution on bacterial and archaeal communities in water and sediments from the Olifants River catchment, South Africa. Water samples showed less microbial species diversity than sediments and both habitats displayed different microbial communities. Within each of these habitats, pollution had no effect on alpha diversity but shaped the microbial composition and taxonomy-based predicted functions. Certain prokaryotic taxa and functional groups were indicative of different degrees of pollution. Heterotrophic taxa (e.g., Flavobacterium sp.) and sulphur-oxidizing bacteria (i.e., Thiobacillus sp.) were indicators of pollution in water and sediments, respectively. Ultimately, this information could be used to develop microbial indicators of water quality degradation.

## Depth-Dependent Variables Shape Community Structure and Functionality in the Prince Edward Islands.
 16.09.2020, _BS Phoma, TP Makhalanyane_


Physicochemical variables limit and control the distribution of microbial communities in all environments. In the oceans, this may significantly influence functional processes such the consumption of dissolved organic material and nutrient sequestration. Yet, the relative contributions of physical factors, such as water mass variability and depth, on functional processes are underexplored. We assessed microbial community structure and functionality in the Prince Edward Islands (PEIs) using 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis and extracellular enzymatic activity assays, respectively. We found that depth and nutrients substantially drive the structural patterns of bacteria and archaea in this region. Shifts from epipelagic to bathypelagic zones were linked to decreases in the activities of several extracellular enzymes. These extracellular enzymatic activities were positively correlated with several phyla including several Alphaproteobacteria (including members of the SAR 11 clade and order Rhodospirillales) and Cyanobacteria. We show that depth-dependent variables may be essential drivers of community structure and functionality in the PEIs.
