The global aging population has led to a rise in age-related health issues, such as malnutrition, metabolic disorders, and even immune decline. Among these concerns, periodontitis holds particular significance for the well-being of the elderly. This study aimed to investigate the impact of aging on inflammatory resorption of alveolar bone in mice with periodontitis, with a specific focus on alterations in the intestinal microenvironment. To achieve this, we established a D-galactose (D-gal)-induced aging mouse model with periodontitis and employed histopathological staining, oxidative stress, and inflammatory factors analyses to assess the severity of periodontitis and the health status. Additionally, the 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics analysis were employed to investigate alterations in the intestinal microbiota and metabolites. Our results showed that D-gal-induced aging mice with periodontitis experienced more pronounced alveolar bone inflammatory resorption and disruptions in the gut barrier, accompanied by an overall decline in physical condition. The microbial composition and structure of aged mice also underwent significant modifications, with a decreased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio. Furthermore, metabolomics analysis demonstrated that D-gal-induced aging primarily influenced lipids and lipid-like molecules metabolism, and enrichment observed in the rheumatoid arthritis and histidine metabolism pathways. These findings provide further evidence that the aging process exacerbates age-related alveolar bone loss (ABL) through disturbances in intestinal homeostasis.

The interactive pathway of the gut-liver axis underscores the significance of microbiome modulation in the pathogenesis and progression of various liver diseases, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This study aims to investigate the disparities in the composition and functionality of the hepatic microbiota between tumor tissues and adjacent normal liver tissues, and their implications in the etiology of HCC. We conducted a comparative analysis of the hepatic microbiome between adjacent normal liver tissues and tumor tissues from HCC patients. Samples were categorized according to the modified Union for International Cancer Control (mUICC) staging system into Non-tumor, mUICC stage I, mUICC stage II, and mUICC stage III groups. Microbial richness and community composition were analyzed, and phylogenetic profiles were examined to identify significantly altered microbial taxa among the groups. Predicted metabolic pathways were analyzed using PICRUSt2. Our analysis did not reveal significant differences in microbial richness and community composition with the development of HCC. However, phylogenetic profiling identified significantly altered microbial taxa among the groups. Sphingobium, known for degrading polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), exhibited a significantly negative correlation with clinical indices in HCC patients. Conversely, Sphingomonas, a gut bacterium associated with various liver diseases, showed a positive correlation. Predicted metabolic pathways suggested a correlation between atrazine degradation and valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis with mUICC stage and tumor size. Our results underscore the critical link between hepatic microbial composition and function and the HCC tumor stage, suggesting a potentially pivotal role in the development of HCC. These findings highlight the importance of targeting the hepatic microbiome for therapeutic strategies in HCC.

## Intestinal microflora and metabolites affect the progression of acute pancreatitis (AP).
 02.11.2024, _Z Wang, M Guo, S Yang, Y Chen, J Cheng, Z Huang, T Wang, X Luo, X He, D Wang, X Xu_


Specific intestinal metabolites are closely associated with the classification, severity, and necrosis of acute pancreatitis (AP) and provide novel insights for in-depth clinical investigations. In this study, the gut microbiota and metabolites of 49 AP patients at different treatment stages and severities were analysed via 16S rDNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics to investigate the trends in gut microbiota composition and metabolome profiles observed in patients with severe AP. These findings revealed an imbalance in intestinal flora homeostasis among AP patients characterized by a decrease in probiotics and an increase in opportunistic pathogens, which leads to damage to the intestinal mucosal barrier through reduced short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) secretion and disruption of the intestinal epithelium. This dysbiosis influences energy metabolism, anti-inflammatory responses, and immune regulation, and these results highlight significant differences in energy metabolism pathways. These findings suggest that the differential composition of intestinal flora, along with alterations in intestinal metabolites and metabolic pathways, contribute to the compromised integrity of the intestinal mucosal barrier and disturbances in energy metabolism in patients with severe AP.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) improve outcomes in advanced melanoma, but many patients are refractory or experience relapse. The gut microbiota modulates antitumor responses. However, inconsistent baseline predictors point to heterogeneity in responses and inadequacy of cross-sectional data. We followed patients with unresectable melanoma from baseline and during anti-PD-1 therapy, collecting fecal and blood samples that were surveyed for changes in the gut microbiota and immune markers. Varying patient responses were linked to different gut microbiota dynamics during ICI treatment. We select complete responders by their stable microbiota functions and validate them using multiple external cohorts and experimentally. We identify major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC class I)-restricted peptides derived from flagellin-related genes of Lachnospiraceae (FLach) as structural homologs of tumor-associated antigens, detect FLach-reactive CD8+ T cells in complete responders before ICI therapy, and demonstrate that FLach peptides improve antitumor immunity. These findings highlight the prognostic value of microbial functions and therapeutic potential of tumor-mimicking microbial peptides.

The International Rome Committee defines Disorders of Gut-Brain Interactions (DGBI) based upon distinct combinations of chronic and/or recurrent unexplained gastrointestinal symptoms. Yet patients often experience overlapping DGBI. Patients with DGBI frequently also suffer from extraintestinal symptoms, including fatigue, sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression. Patients with overlapping DGBI typically experience more severe GI symptoms and increased psychosocial burden. Concerning the pathophysiology, DGBI are associated with disruptions in gut motility, function of the brain and enteric neurons, immune function, and genetic markers, with recent findings revealing gut microbiome alterations linked to these mechanisms of DGBI. Emerging evidence summarized in this review suggests that the microbiome influences various established disease mechanisms of different DGBI groups. Overall, changes in the gastrointestinal microbiome do not seem to be linked to a specific DGBI subgroup but may play a key role in the manifestation of different DGBI and, subsequently, overlap of DGBI. Understanding these shared mechanisms and the role of the gastrointestinal microbiome, particularly for overlapping DGBI, might aid in developing more precise diagnostic criteria and treatment strategies while developing personalized interventions that target specific mechanisms to improve patient outcomes.

## The oncomicrobiome: New insights into microorganisms in cancer.
 05.11.2024, _Y Ma, T Chen, T Sun, D Dilimulati, Y Xiao_


The discoveries of the oncomicrobiome (intratumoral microbiome) and oncomicrobiota (intratumoral microbiota) represent significant advances in tumor research and have rapidly become of key interest to the field. Within tumors, microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, and archaea form the oncomicrobiota and are primarily found within tumor cells, immunocytes, and the intercellular matrix. The oncomicrobiome exhibits marked heterogeneity and is associated with tumor initiation, progression, metastasis, and treatment response. Interactions between the oncomicrobiome and the immune system can modulate host antitumor immunity, influencing the efficacy of immunotherapies. Oncomicrobiome research also faces numerous challenges, including overcoming methodological issues such as low target abundance, susceptibility to contamination, and biases in sample handling and analysis methods across different studies. Furthermore, studies of the oncomicrobiome may be confounded by baseline differences in microbiomes among populations driven by both environmental and genetic factors. Most studies to date have revealed associations between the oncomicrobiome and tumors, but very few have established mechanistic links between the two. This review introduces the relevant concepts, detection methods, sources, and characteristics of the oncomicrobiome. We then describe the composition of the oncomicrobiome in common tumors and its role in shaping the tumor microenvironment. We also discuss the current problems and challenges to be overcome in this rapidly progressing field.

## α-synuclein overexpression and the microbiome shape the gut and brain metabolome in mice.
 05.11.2024, _LH Morais, JC Boktor, S MahmoudianDehkordi, R Kaddurah-Daouk, SK Mazmanian_


Pathological forms of α-synuclein contribute to synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease (PD). Most cases of PD arise from gene-environment interactions. Microbiome composition is altered in PD, and gut bacteria are causal to symptoms in animal models. We quantitatively profiled nearly 630 metabolites in the gut, plasma, and brain of α-synuclein-overexpressing (ASO) mice, compared to wild-type (WT) animals, and comparing germ-free (GF) to specific pathogen-free (SPF) animals (n = 5 WT-SPF; n = 6 ASO-SPF; n = 6 WT-GF; n = 6 ASO-GF). Many differentially expressed metabolites in ASO mice are also dysregulated in human PD patients, including amine oxides, bile acids and indoles. The microbial metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) strongly correlates from the gut to the plasma to the brain in mice, notable since TMAO is elevated in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid of PD patients. These findings uncover broad metabolomic changes that are influenced by the intersection of host genetics and microbiome in a mouse model of PD.

Gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota plays an active role in regulating the host's immune system and metabolism, as well as certain pathophysiological processes. Diet is the main factor modulating GI microbiota composition and studies have shown that high fat (HF) diets induce detrimental changes (dysbiosis) in the GI bacterial makeup. HF diet induced dysbiosis has been associated with structural and functional changes in gut-brain vagally mediated signaling system, associated with overeating and obesity. Although HF-driven changes in microbiota composition are sufficient to alter vagal signaling, it is unknown if improving microbiota composition after diet-induced obesity has been established can ameliorate gut-brain signaling and metabolic outcomes. In this study, we evaluated the effect of lean gut microbiota transfer in obese, vagally compromised, rats on gut-brain communication, food intake, and body weight. Male rats were maintained on regular chow or 45% HF diet for nine weeks followed by three weeks of microbiota depletion using antibiotics. The animals were then divided into four groups (n = 10 each): LF - control fed regular chow, LF-LF - chow fed animals that received microbiota from chow fed donors, HF-LF - HF fed animals that received microbiota from chow fed donors, and HF-HF - HF fed animals that received microbiota from HF fed donors. HF-LF animals received inulin as a prebiotic to aid the establishment of the lean microbiome. We found that transferring a LF microbiota to HF fed animals (HF-LF) reduced caloric intake during the light phase when compared with HF-HF rats and prevented additional excessive weight gain. HF-LF animals displayed an increase in postprandial activation of both primary sensory neurons innervating the GI tract and brainstem secondary neurons. We concluded from these data that improving microbiota composition in obese rats is sufficient to ameliorate gut-brain communication and restore normal feeding patterns which was associated with a reduction in weight gain.

## Microbiome divergence of marine gastropod species separated by the Isthmus of Panama.
 31.10.2024, _AT Neu, ME Torchin, EE Allen, K Roy_


The rise of the Isthmus of Panama separated the populations of many marine organisms, which then diverged into new geminate sister species currently living in the Eastern Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. However, we know very little about how such evolutionary divergences of host species have shaped the compositions of their microbiomes. Here, we compared the microbiomes of whole-body and shell-surface samples of geminate species of marine gastropods in the genera Cerithium and Cerithideopsis to those of congeneric outgroups. Our results suggest that the effects of ~3 million years of separation and isolation on microbiome composition varied among host genera and between sample types within the same hosts. In the whole-body samples, microbiome compositions of geminate species pairs tended to be similar, likely due to host filtering, although the strength of this relationship varied among the two groups and across similarity metrics. Shell-surface microbiomes show contrasting patterns, with co-divergence between the host taxa and a small number of microbial clades evident in Cerithideopsis but not Cerithium. These results suggest that (i) isolation of host populations after the rise of the Isthmus of Panama affected microbiomes of geminate hosts in a complex and host-specific manner, and (ii) host-associated microbial taxa respond differently to vicariance events than the hosts themselves.IMPORTANCEWhile considerable work has been done on evolutionary divergences of marine species in response to the rise of the Isthmus of Panama, which separated two previously connected oceans, how this event shaped the microbiomes of these marine hosts remains poorly known. Using whole-body and shell-surface microbiomes of closely related gastropod species from opposite sides of the Isthmus, we show that divergences of microbial taxa after the formation of the Isthmus are often not concordant with those of their gastropod hosts. Our results show that evolutionary responses of marine gastropod-associated microbiomes to major environmental perturbations are complex and are shaped more by local environments than host evolutionary history.

_Plants, Microbiota, Agriculture, Bacteria, Synthetic Biology_
Harnessing beneficial microorganisms is seen as a promising approach to enhance sustainable agriculture production. Synthetic communities (SynComs) are increasingly being used to study relevant microbial activities and interactions with the plant host. Yet, the lack of community standards limits the efficiency and progress in this important area of research. To address this gap, we recommend three actions: (1) defining reference SynComs; (2) establishing community standards, protocols and benchmark data for constructing and using SynComs; and (3) creating an infrastructure for sharing strains and data. We also outline opportunities to develop SynCom research through technical advances, linking to field studies, and filling taxonomic blind spots to move towards fully representative SynComs.

Saline lakes, characterized by high salinity and limited nutrient availability, provide an ideal environment for studying extreme halophiles and their biogeochemical processes. The present study examined prokaryotic microbial communities and their ecological functions in lentic sediments (with the salinity gradient and time series) using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and a metagenomic approach. Our findings revealed a negative correlation between microbial diversity and salinity. The notable predominance of Archaea in high-salinity lakes signified a considerable alteration in the composition of the microbial community. The results indicate that elevated salinity promotes homogeneous selection pressures, causing substantial alterations in microbial diversity and community structure, and simultaneously hindering interactions among microorganisms. This results in a notable decrease in the complexity of microbial ecological networks, ultimately influencing the overall ecological functional responses of microbial communities such as carbon fixation, sulfur, and nitrogen metabolism. Overall, our findings reveal salinity drives a notable predominance of Archaea, selects for species adapted to extreme conditions, and decreases microbial community complexity within saline lake ecosystems.

Water scarcity has evolved into a pressing global issue, significantly impacting numerous regions worldwide. The use of treated wastewater stands out as a promising solution to this problem. However, the proliferation of various contaminants, primarily Antimicrobial Resistance Genes (ARGs), poses a significant challenge to its safe and sustainable use. In this study, we assessed the composition and abundance of 373 ARGs, corresponding to 31 different classes of antibiotics, in six wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in Agadir city of Morocco. Influent and effluent samples were collected during the months of February and July in 2020, in addition to samples from the Atlantic Ocean. In total, 223 ARGs were uncovered, highlighting in particular resistance to aminoglycoside, macrolide lincosamide, beta-lactamase, chloramphenicol, sulfonamide, tetracycline, and other antibiotics. The mechanisms of action of these ARGs were mainly antibiotic inactivation, antibiotic target alteration, efflux pump and cellular protection. Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were detected at high levels their co-occurrence with ARGs highlights their involvement in the acquisition and transmission of ARGs in microbial communities through horizontal gene transfer. While many wastewater treatment methods effectively reduce a large proportion of gene material and pathogens, a substantial fraction of ARGs and other contaminants persist in treated wastewater. This persistence poses potential risks to both human health and the environment, warranting the need of more effective treatment strategies.

Coal, a sedimentary rock harbours a complex microbial community that plays a significant role in its formation and characteristics. However, coal metagenome sequencing and studies were less, limiting our understanding of this complex ecosystem. This study aimed to reconstruct high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the coal sample collected in the Neyveli mine to explore the unrevealed diversity of the coal microbiome. Using Illumina sequencing, we obtained high-quality raw reads in FASTQ format. Subsequently, de novo assembly and binning with metaWRAP software facilitated the reconstruction of coal MAGs. Quality assessment using CheckM identified 10 High-Quality MAGs (HQ MAGs), 7 medium-quality MAGs (MQ MAGs), and 6 low-quality MAGs (LQ MAGs). Further analysis using GTDB-Tk revealed four HQ MAGs as known species like Dermacoccus abyssi, Sphingomonas aquatilis, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Burkholderia cenocepacia. The remaining six HQ MAGs were classified as Comamonas, Arthrobacter, Noviherbaspirillum, Acidovorax, Oxalicibacterium, and Bordetella and designated as novel genomes by the validation of digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH). Phylogenetic analysis and further pangenome analysis across the phylogenetic groups revealed a similar pattern with a high proportion of cloud genes. We further analysed the functional potential of these MAGs and closely related genomes using COG. The comparative functional genomics revealed that novel genomes are highly versatile, potentially reflecting adaptations to the coal environment. BlastKOALA was used to conduct a detailed analysis of the metabolic pathways associated with the MAGs. This study highlights the comparative genomic analysis of novel coal genomes with their closely related genomes to understand the evolutionary relationships and functional properties.
