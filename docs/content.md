Many patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) consume alcohol chronically and in large amounts that alter intestinal microbiota, damage the gastrointestinal tract, and thereby injure other organs via malabsorption and intestinal inflammation. We hypothesized that alcohol consumption and subsequent abstinence would change the gut microbiome in adults admitted to a treatment program. Stool and oral specimens, diet data, gastrointestinal assessment scores, anxiety, depression measures and drinking amounts were collected longitudinally for up to 4 weeks in 22 newly abstinent inpatients with AUD who were dichotomized as less heavy drinkers (LHD, &lt;10 drinks/d) and very heavy drinkers (VHD, 10 or more drinks/d). Next-generation 16 S rRNA gene sequencing was performed to measure the gut and oral microbiome at up to ten time points/subject and LHD and VHD were compared for change in principal components, Shannon diversity index and specific genera. The first three principal components explained 46.7% of the variance in gut microbiome diversity across time and all study subjects, indicating the change in gut microbiome following abstinence. The first time point was an outlier in three-dimensional principal component space versus all other time points. The gut microbiota in LHD and VHD were significantly dissimilar in change from day 1 to day 5 (p = .03) and from day 1 to week 3 (p = .02). The VHD drinking group displayed greater change from baseline. The Shannon diversity index of the gut microbiome changed significantly during abstinence in five participants. In both groups, the Shannon diversity was lower in the oral microbiome than gut. Ten total genera were shared between oral and stool in the AUD participants. These data were compared with healthy controls from the Human Microbiome Project to investigate the concept of a core microbiome. Rapid changes in gut microbiome following abstinence from alcohol suggest resilience of the gut microbiome in AUD and reflects the benefits of refraining from the highest levels of alcohol and potential benefits of abstinence.

## Comparative evaluation of peptidome and microbiota in different types of saliva samples.
 04.07.2020, _C Zhu, C Yuan, FQ Wei, XY Sun, SG Zheng_


Clinical and research interest in salivary peptidome and microbiota is ever-growing owing to its great value for diagnosis, risk assessment and prediction of prognosis in oral and systemic diseases. Saliva can be stimulated for the purpose of rapid collection, but currently there are no studies systematically addressing the similarities and differences of salivary peptidome and microbiota in different types of samples. The purpose of this study was to investigate the variations of salivary peptidome and microbial profiles in response to different stimulating conditions.

The brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens, the most destructive pest of rice, is a typical monophagous herbivore that feeds exclusively on rice sap, which migrates over long distances. Outbreaks of it have re-occurred approximately every three years in Asia. It has also been used as a model system for ecological studies and for developing effective pest management. To better understand how a monophagous sap-sucking arthropod herbivore has adapted to its exclusive host selection and to provide insights to improve pest control, we analyzed the genomes of the brown planthopper and its two endosymbionts.

## Hemolysin BL from novel Bacillus toyonensis BV-17 induces antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo.
 03.07.2020, _J Chen, S Hu, D Ji, Z Gao, H Wang, Y Yang, Y Chen, J Gu_


The gut microbiota plays an important role in cancer development and immunotherapy. Bacterial toxins have enormous antitumor potential due to their cytotoxicity and ability to activate the immune system. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, we compared the gut microbiota composition of fecal samples from healthy individuals and patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) and observed that the genus Bacillus was common in the healthy donors but was absent in the CRC patients. Further, we isolated a novel Bacillus toyonensis BV-17 from the fecal samples of the healthy individuals. Our results showed that the supernatant of the Bacillus toyonensis BV-17 cultures could quickly kill various tumor cell lines within minutes in vitro, by causing cell membrane disruption, blebbing, and leakage of cytoplasmic content. Fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) and mass spectrometry analysis identified hemolysin BL (HBL) as the effector molecule, which exhibits a different cytotoxicity mechanism compared to previous studies. Intra-tumor injection of low dose HBL inhibited the growth of both treated and untreated tumors in mice. The outcomes of this pioneer study suggest that HBL exhibits antitumor activity and is a potential chemotherapeutic agent that could be engineered to target only tumor cells in future.

## Modeling the effect of DAV132, a novel colon-targeted adsorbent, on fecal concentrations of moxifloxacin and gut microbiota diversity in healthy volunteers.
 03.07.2020, _J Guk, J Guedj, C Burdet, A Andremont, J de Gunzburg, A Ducher, F Mentré_


To prevent antibiotic-induced perturbations on gut microbiota, DAV132, a novel colon-targeted adsorbent, which sequesters antibiotic residues in the lower gastrointestinal tract was developed. We built an integrated pharmacological model of how DAV132 reduces fecal free moxifloxacin (MXF) and preserves gut microbiota. We used plasma and fecal free MXF concentrations, and Shannon diversity index from 16S rRNA gene metagenomics analysis of fecal microbiota, of 143 healthy volunteers assigned randomly to receive MXF only, or with ten DAV132 dose regimens, or to a control group. We modeled reduced fecal MXF concentrations using a transit model for DAV132 kinetics and a Michaelis-Menten model with an effect of the amount of activated charcoal on adsorption efficacy. Changes in MXF-induced perturbations on gut microbiota diversity were then quantified through a turn-over model with the Emax model. With the developed model, the efficiency of pharmacokinetic antagonism and its consequences on gut microbiota diversity were quantified.

## Allicin-induced host-gut microbe interactions improves energy homeostasis.
 03.07.2020, _C Zhang, X He, Y Sheng, C Yang, J Xu, S Zheng, J Liu, W Xu, Y Luo, K Huang_


Allicin (diallylthiosulfinate) is a natural food compound with multiple biological and pharmacological functions. However, the mechanism of beneficial role of Allicin on energy homeostasis is not well studied. Gut microbiota (GM) profoundly affects host metabolism via microbiota-host interactions and coevolution. Here, we investigated the interventions of beneficial microbiome induced by Allicin on energy homeostasis, particularly obesity, and related complications. Interestingly, Allicin treatment significantly improved GM composition and induced the most significant alteration enrichment of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. Importantly, transplantation of the Allicin-induced GM to HFD mice (AGMT) played a remarkable role in decreasing adiposity, maintaining glucose homeostasis, and ameliorating hepatic steatosis. Furthermore, AGMT was effective in modulating lipid metabolism, activated brown adipose tissues (BATs), induced browning in sWAT, reduced inflammation, and inhibited the degradation of intestinal villi. Mechanically, AGMT significantly increased Blautia [short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing microbiota] and Bifidobacterium in HFD mice, also increased the SCFAs in the cecum, which has been proved many beneficial effects on energy homeostasis. Our study highlights that Allicin-induced host-gut microbe interactions plays an important role in regulating energy homeostasis, which provides a promising potential therapy for obesity and metabolic disorders based on host-microbe interactions.

## Evidence of Microbiome-Drug Interactions between the Antimalarial Lumefantrine and Gut Microbiota in Mice.
 03.07.2020, _MM Ippolito, JE Denny, E Nenortas, TA Shapiro, NW Schmidt_


The antimalarial drug lumefantrine (LF) exhibits erratic pharmacokinetics (PK). Intersubject variability might be attributed, in part, to differences in the gut microbiome-mediated drug metabolism. We assessed LF disposition in healthy mice stratified by enterotype to explore associations between the gut microbiota and LF PK. Gut microbiota enterotypes were classified according to abundance and diversity indices from 16S rRNA sequencing. Pharmacokinetic parameters were computed using noncompartmental analysis. Two distinctive enterotypes were identified. Maximal concentration (Cmax) and total drug exposure measured as the area under the drug concentration-time curve (AUC0-24) differed significantly between the groups. The mean and SD of Cmax were 660 ± 220 ng/mL versus 390 ± 59 ng/mL (P = 0.02), and AUC0-24 was 9,600 ± 2,800 versus 5,800 ± 810 ng × h/mL (P = 0.01). In healthy mice intragastrically dosed with the antimalarial drug LF in combination with artemether, LF exposure was associated with the gut bacterial community structure. Studies of xenobiotic-microbiota interactions can inform drug posology and elucidate mechanisms of drug disposition.

## A theoretic approach to the mode of gut microbiome translocation in SIV-infected Asian macaques.
 03.07.2020, _W Li, ZS Ma_


Human gut microbiome could translocate to other tissues, and the relocation triggered by HIV/SIV infection has received increasing attention. However, the underlying mode of this translocation, whether it is deterministic or random (passive) process, is not clear, not to mention quantitative estimation of the relocation probability and rates. Using multi-tissue microbiome datasets collected from SIV-infected macaques, originally reported by Klase et al. (2015), we apply Hubbell's unified neutral theory of biodiversity (UNTB) implemented by Harris et al. (2015) in the form of multi-site neutral (MSN) model to explore the translocation mode and rates of the gut microbiome. We found that (i) The translocation from gastrointestinal tract to tissues was driven by stochastic (neutral) forces as revealed by 100% neutrality-passing rates with MSN testing; (ii) The translocation probability from gastrointestinal tract to tissues is significantly larger than the baseline dispersal rates occurring within gastrointestinal tract (0.234 vs. 0.006 at the phylum level, p&lt;0.001). (iii) Approximately 23% of phyla and 55% of genera were migrated from gastrointestinal tract to the tissues (liver and mesenteric lymph nodes). Our findings offer the first interpretation of the microbial translocation mode from gastrointestinal tract to tissues, and the first estimates of the translocation probability and level.

## Impact of Initial Feeding and Molting on Tachypleus tridentatus Gut Microbiota.
 03.07.2020, _F Miao, Z Zhao, Q Li, J Song, Y Wang, M Hu_


Tri-spine horseshoe crabs (HSCs) Tachypleus tridentatus have been facing the threat of population depletion for decades, and the physiology and microbiology of their early life stages are lacking. To explore what directs the change of juvenile T. tridentatus gut microbiota and how gut microbiota change, by using 16S rRNA sequencing of gut samples we detected the intestinal microbiome of juvenile HSCs and compared the impact of initial molting and initial feeding, as well as the effect of environment. Results showed that the predominant phyla in the gut microbial community of juvenile HSCs are Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. The richness and diversity of intestinal microbes greatly decreased after initial molting. Microbial-mediated functions predicted by PICRUSt showed that "Signal Transduction", "Cellular Processes and Signaling", "Infective Diseases" and "Digestive System" pathways significantly increased in 2nd instars. As for the effect of environment, the connection between living environment and the intestinal microbiome started to manifest after initial molting. Unexpectedly, initial feeding treatment slightly affected the intestinal microbiome of T. tridentatus in the early life stage, whereas the effect of initial molting was significant. The present study provided the first insight into the gut microbiota of T. tridentatus, and the findings led a new sight to explain what guide the change of gut microbiota.

## Osmotic stress induces gut microbiota community shift in fish.
 03.07.2020, _KP Lai, X Lin, N Tam, JCH Ho, MK Wong, J Gu, TF Chan, WKF Tse_


Alteration of the gut microbiota plays an important role in animal health and metabolic diseases. However, little is known with respect to the influence of environmental osmolality on the gut microbial community. The aim of the current study was to determine whether the reduction in salinity affects the gut microbiota and identify its potential role in salinity acclimation. Using Oryzias melastigma as a model organism to perform progressive hypotonic transfer experiments, we evaluated three conditions: seawater control (SW), SW to 50% sea water transfer (SFW), and SW to SFW to freshwater transfer (FW). Our results showed that the SFW and FW transfer groups contained higher operational taxonomic unit microbiota diversities. The dominant bacteria in all conditions constituted the phylum Proteobacteria, with the majority in the SW and SFW transfer gut comprising Vibrio at the genus level, whereas this population was replaced by Pseudomonas in the FW transfer gut. Furthermore, our data revealed that the FW transfer gut microbiota exhibited a reduced renin-angiotensin system, which is important in SW acclimation. In addition, induced detoxification and immune mechanisms were found in the FW transfer gut microbiota. The shift of the bacteria community in different osmolality environments indicated possible roles of bacteria in facilitating host acclimation. This article is protected by copyright.

## The Gut-Eye Axis: Lessons Learned from Murine Models.
 03.07.2020, _JL Floyd, MB Grant_


A healthy gut microbiota is essential in maintaining the human body in a homeostatic state by its functions in digestion and immune tolerance. Under states of aberrant microbial composition or function (dysbiosis), the gut microbiota induces systemic inflammation that can lead to the onset of many diseases. In this review, we describe some evidence, largely from rodent studies, that supports the possible role of a dysbiotic gut microbiota in the onset and exacerbation of ocular diseases, primarily diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, choroidal neovascularization, and uveitis. Furthermore, we examine several potential therapeutic measures that show promise in restoring the gut microbiota to a eubiotic state, preventing the aforementioned disease pathologies.

## The colonic mucosa-associated microbiome in SIV infection: shift towards Bacteroidetes coincides with mucosal CD4+ T cell depletion and enterocyte damage.
 03.07.2020, _K Allers, C Stahl-Hennig, T Fiedler, D Wibberg, J Hofmann, D Kunkel, V Moos, B Kreikemeyer, J Kalinowski, T Schneider_


The intesinal microbiome is considered important in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) pathogenesis and therefore represents a potential therapeutic target to improve the patients' health status. Longitudinal alterations in the colonic mucosa-associated microbiome during simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection were investigated using a 16S rRNA amplicon approach on the Illumina sequencing platform and bioinformatics analyses. Following SIV infection of six animals, no alterations in microbial composition were observed before the viral load peaked in the colon. At the time of acute mucosal SIV replication, the phylum Bacteroidetes including the Bacteroidia class as well as the phylum Firmicutes and its families Ruminococcaceae and Eubacteriaceae became more abundant. Enrichment of Bacteroidetes was maintained until the chronic phase of SIV infection. The shift towards Bacteroidetes in the mucosa-associated microbiome was associated with the extent of SIV infection-induced mucosal CD4+ T cell depletion and correlated with increasing rates of enterocyte damage. These observations suggest that Bacteroidetes strains increase during virus-induced mucosal immune destruction. As Bacteroidetes belong to the lipopolysaccharide- and short chain fatty acids-producing bacteria, their rapid enrichment may contribute to inflammatory tissue damage and metabolic alterations in SIV/HIV infection. These aspects should be considered in future studies on therapeutic interventions.

## Re-Analysis of 16S Amplicon Sequencing Data Reveals Soil Microbial Population Shifts in Rice Fields under Drought Condition.
 03.07.2020, _SW Jang, MH Yoou, WJ Hong, YJ Kim, EJ Lee, KH Jung_


Rice (Oryza sativa. L) has been intensively studied to ensure a stable global supply of this commodity in the face of rapid global climate change. A critical factor that decreases crop yield is drought, which has been analyzed in various ways through many researches. Microbiome-based studies of rice investigate the symbiosis between rice and bacteria, which has been proposed as a way to overcome problems caused by drought. Several rice-associated metagenomic profiles obtained under drought conditions have been reported since the advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) technology. To elucidate the future diversity of plants and microorganisms and to promote sustainable agriculture, we reanalyzed 64 of the publicly available 16S amplicon sequencing data produced under drought condition. In the process of integrating data sets, however, we found an inconsistency that serves as a bottleneck for microbiome-based sustainability research. While this report provides clues about the composition of the microbiome under the drought conditions, the results are affected by differences in the location of the experiments, sampling conditions, and analysis protocols. Re-analysis of amplicon sequencing data of the soil microbiome in rice fields suggests that microbial composition shifts in response to drought condition and the presence of plants. Among the bacteria involved, the phylum Proteobacteria appears to play the most important role in the survival of rice under drought condition.

## Integrated network modeling approach defines key metabolic responses of soil microbiomes to perturbations.
 03.07.2020, _RS McClure, JY Lee, TR Chowdhury, EM Bottos, RA White, YM Kim, CD Nicora, TO Metz, KS Hofmockel, JK Jansson, HS Song_


The soil environment is constantly changing due to shifts in soil moisture, nutrient availability and other conditions. To contend with these changes, soil microorganisms have evolved a variety of ways to adapt to environmental perturbations, including regulation of gene expression. However, it is challenging to untangle the complex phenotypic response of the soil to environmental change, partly due to the absence of predictive modeling frameworks that can mechanistically link molecular-level changes in soil microorganisms to a community's functional phenotypes (or metaphenome). Towards filling this gap, we performed a combined analysis of metabolic and gene co-expression networks to explore how the soil microbiome responded to changes in soil moisture and nutrient conditions and to determine which genes were expressed under a given condition. Our integrated modeling approach revealed previously unknown, but critically important aspects of the soil microbiomes' response to environmental perturbations. Incorporation of metabolomic and transcriptomic data into metabolic reaction networks identified condition-specific signature genes that are uniquely associated with dry, wet, and glycine-amended conditions. A subsequent gene co-expression network analysis revealed that drought-associated genes occupied more central positions in a network model of the soil community, compared to the genes associated with wet, and glycine-amended conditions. These results indicate the occurrence of system-wide metabolic coordination when soil microbiomes cope with moisture or nutrient perturbations. Importantly, the approach that we demonstrate here to analyze large-scale multi-omics data from a natural soil environment is applicable to other microbiome systems for which multi-omics data are available.
