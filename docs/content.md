## The Microbiota of Human Lung of Pulmonary Tuberculosis and the Alteration Caused by Anti-tuberculosis Drugs.
 20.09.2022, _M Zhang, L Shen, X Zhou, H Chen_


An in-depth understanding of the lung microbiota in tuberculosis (TB) infection could provide optimal strategies for the prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease. Only a few studies have investigated the impact of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection and anti-TB treatment on the lung microbiota. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and blood samples were collected from 23 active TB patients (TBZ), 17 latent tuberculosis infection patients (LTBI), 13 healthy controls (HC), and 14 active TB patients with 1-month anti-TB therapy (TBM) for 16S RNA sequencing and serological indexes, respectively. Low body mass index, albumin, and total triglyceride levels were detected in TBZ. Pulmonary Mtb infection led to a minor decrease in the alpha diversity of the lung microbiota in TBZ than HC, but a significant difference was noted in beta diversity. Subsequently, anti-TB therapy caused a rapid alteration in the lung community structure due to reduced alpha and beta diversity. Proteobacteria were abundant in TBZ samples, while Firmicutes was predominant in the LITB and HC samples. Lactobacillus and Subdoligranulum (genera) were the most unique in the LTBI and HC group, respectively. The TBM group showed the most predominant abundance of Bacteroides, Oscillospira, and Ruminococcus (genera). Functional pathways, such as indole alkaloid biosynthesis, Wnt signaling pathway, endocytosis, and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, significantly decreased in the TBM group compared with TBZ group. Pulmonary TB and anti-TB treatment caused a distinct dysbiosis of the lung microbiome. The current findings suggested potential links between the lung microbiota and TB onset, progression, and treatment.

Kidney stone disease is one of the oldest diseases known to medicine; however, the mechanisms of stone formation and development remain largely unclear. Over the past decades, a variety of theories and strategies have been developed and utilized in the surgical management of kidney stones, as a result of recent technological advances. Observations from the authors and other research groups suggest that there are five entirely different main mechanisms for kidney stone formation. Urinary supersaturation and crystallization are the driving force for intrarenal crystal precipitation. Randall's plaques are recognized as the origin of calcium oxalate stone formation. Sex hormones may be key players in the development of nephrolithiasis and may thus be potential targets for new drugs to suppress kidney stone formation. The microbiome, including urease‑producing bacteria, nanobacteria and intestinal microbiota, is likely to have a profound effect on urological health, both positive and negative, owing to its metabolic output and other contributions. Lastly, the immune response, and particularly macrophage differentiation, play crucial roles in renal calcium oxalate crystal formation. In the present study, the current knowledge for each of these five aspects of kidney stone formation is reviewed. This knowledge may be used to explore novel research opportunities and improve the understanding of the initiation and development of kidney stones for urologists, nephrologists and primary care.

## Comparison of tumor-associated and nontumor-associated esophageal mucosa microbiota in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.
 20.09.2022, _B Zhang, Q Xiao, H Chen, T Zhou, Y Yin_


Esophageal microbiota plays important roles in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The aims of this study were to clarify the changes in the bacterial community during ESCC development and identify latent pathogenic bacteria which may contribute to esophageal carcinogenesis and progression. Fresh tumor and nontumor esophageal mucosal samples were collected from 31 men with ESCC. High-throughput 16s rRNA sequencing was performed, and the operational taxonomic unit data and bacterial classification annotation were obtained and analyzed. The Ace, Chao, Shannon, Simpson indexes, and operational taxonomic unit numbers were higher in nontumor tissues than in tumor tissues, although without statistical significance. There were 4 phyla and 28 genera found to show significant differences between tumor and nontumor samples. The general probiotic Lactobacillus was 1.98-fold higher in nontumor tissues, while the general pathogenic genera Fusobacterium was 4.35-fold higher in tumor tissues. For tumor tissue samples, the genera Treponema and Brevibacillus were significantly higher in N1 and N2 stages, respectively, and Acinetobacter was significantly higher in T3 stage. For nontumor tissues, the genus Fusicatenibacter was significantly higher in T2 stage, and Corynebacterium, Aggregatibacter, Saccharimonadaceae-TM7x, and Cupriavidus were significantly higher in T4 stage. Additionally, bacteria related to nitrotoluene degradation were enriched in nontumor tissues, while bacteria related to base excision repair were enriched in tumor tissues. The relative abundance of several phyla and genera are different between tumor and nontumor tissue samples. The altered bacterial microbiota is correlated with different tumor stages and some microbes may take part in the carcinogenesis and development of ESCC.

## Modulatory role of gut microbiota in cholesterol and glucose metabolism: Potential implications for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease Atherosclerosis.
 20.09.2022, _J Roessler, DM Leistner, U Landmesser, A Haghikia_


Accumulating evidence suggests an important role of gut microbiota in physiological processes of host metabolism as well as cardiometabolic disease. Recent advances in metagenomic and metabolomic research have led to discoveries of novel pathways in which intestinal microbial metabolism of dietary nutrients is linked to metabolic profiles and cardiovascular disease risk. A number of metaorganismal circuits have been identified by microbiota transplantation studies and experimental models using germ-free rodents. Many of these pathways involve gut microbiota-related bioactive metabolites that impact host metabolism, in particular lipid and glucose homeostasis, partly via specific host receptors. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of how the gut microbiome can impact cardiometabolic phenotypes and provide an overview of recent advances of gut microbiome research. Finally, the potential of modulating intestinal microbiota composition and/or targeting microbiota-related pathways for novel preventive and therapeutic strategies in cardiometabolic and cardiovascular diseases will be discussed.

## Community and shotgun metagenomic analysis of Alligator mississippiensis oral cavity and GI tracts reveal complex ecosystems and potential reservoirs of antibiotic resistance.
 17.09.2022, _J Perez-Marron, C Sanders, E Gomez, S Escopete, T Owerkowicz, PM Orwin_


We report here the community structure and functional analysis of the microbiome of the Alligator mississippiensis GI tract from the oral cavity through the entirety of the digestive tract. Although many vertebrate microbiomes have been studied in recent years, the archosaur microbiome has only been given cursory attention. In the oral cavity we used amplicon-based community analysis to examine the structure of the oral microbiome during alligator development. We found a community that diversified over time and showed many of the hallmarks we would expect of a stable oral community. This is a bit surprising given the rapid turnover of alligator teeth but suggests that the stable gumline microbes are able to rapidly colonize the emerging teeth. As we move down the digestive tract, we were able to use both long and short read sequencing approaches to evaluate the community using a shotgun metagenomics approach. Long read sequencing was applied to samples from the stomach/duodenum, and the colorectal region, revealing a fairly uniform and low complexity community made up primarily of proteobacteria at the top of the gut and much more diversity in the colon. We used deep short read sequencing to further interrogate this colorectal community. The two sequencing approaches were concordant with respect to community structure but substantially more detail was available in the short read data, in spite of high levels of host DNA contamination. Using both approaches we were able to show that the colorectal community is a potential reservoir for antibiotic resistance, human pathogens such as Clostridiodes difficile and a possible source of novel antimicrobials or other useful secondary metabolites.

## Current understanding of plant-microbe interaction through the lenses of multi-omics approaches and their benefits in sustainable agriculture.
 20.09.2022, _D Diwan, MM Rashid, A Vaishnav_


The success of sustainable agricultural practices has now become heavily dependent on the interactions between crop plants and their associated microbiome. Continuous advancement in high throughput sequencing platforms, omics-based approaches, and gene editing technologies has remarkably accelerated this area of research. It has enabled us to characterize the interactions of plants with associated microbial communities more comprehensively and accurately. Furthermore, the genomic and post-genomic era has significantly refined our perspective toward the complex mechanisms involved in those interactions, opening new avenues for efficiently deploying the knowledge in developing sustainable agricultural practices. This review focuses on our fundamental understanding of plant-microbe interactions and the contribution of existing multi-omics approaches, including those under active development and their tremendous success in unraveling different aspects of the complex network between plant hosts and microbes. In addition, we have also discussed the importance of sustainable and eco-friendly agriculture and the associated outstanding challenges ahead.

## Mitigating abiotic stress: microbiome engineering for improving agricultural production and environmental sustainability.
 20.09.2022, _M Phour, SS Sindhu_


The responses of plants to different abiotic stresses and mechanisms involved in their mitigation are discussed. Production of osmoprotectants, antioxidants, enzymes and other metabolites by beneficial microorganisms and their bioengineering ameliorates environmental stresses to improve food production. Progressive intensification of global agriculture, injudicious use of agrochemicals and change in climate conditions have deteriorated soil health, diminished the microbial biodiversity and resulted in environment pollution along with increase in biotic and abiotic stresses. Extreme weather conditions and erratic rains have further imposed additional stress for the growth and development of plants. Dominant abiotic stresses comprise drought, temperature, increased salinity, acidity, metal toxicity and nutrient starvation in soil, which severely limit crop production. For promoting sustainable crop production in environmentally challenging environments, use of beneficial microbes has emerged as a safer and sustainable means for mitigation of abiotic stresses resulting in improved crop productivity. These stress-tolerant microorganisms play an effective role against abiotic stresses by enhancing the antioxidant potential, improving nutrient acquisition, regulating the production of plant hormones, ACC deaminase, siderophore and exopolysaccharides and accumulating osmoprotectants and, thus, stimulating plant biomass and crop yield. In addition, bioengineering of beneficial microorganisms provides an innovative approach to enhance stress tolerance in plants. The use of genetically engineered stress-tolerant microbes as inoculants of crop plants may facilitate their use for enhanced nutrient cycling along with amelioration of abiotic stresses to improve food production for the ever-increasing population. In this chapter, an overview is provided about the current understanding of plant-bacterial interactions that help in alleviating abiotic stress in different crop systems in the face of climate change. This review largely focuses on the importance and need of sustainable and environmentally friendly approaches using beneficial microbes for ameliorating the environmental stresses in our agricultural systems.

## Anthocyanin Addition to Kefir: Metagenomic Analysis of Microbial Community Structure.
 20.09.2022, _S Aydin, AA Erözden, N Tavşanlı, A Müdüroğlu, M Çalışkan, İ Kara_


The addition of anthocyanin to kefir for the production of more functional and bio-diversified kefir beverages has the potential to increase kefir's healthful activities. In the present study, anthocyanin extracts, obtained from black carrots, were added into kefir mixture during the fermentation process in different concentrations (1% and 5%, w/v). These kefir samples were then analyzed in terms of their microbiological qualities by metagenomic analysis. The results of the analyses show that the addition of anthocyanin has significant impacts on the community structure of kefir microbiome which in turn directly affects the expected health impacts of the beverage. Kefir with no anthocyanin included predominantly probiotic bacteria such as Lactococcus lactis (34%) and Lactobacillus kefiri (34%). On the other hand, kefir with 1% anthocyanin demonstrated a more balanced distribution of probiotic species like Lb. kefiri (17%), Leuconostoc mesenteroides (9%), and Lc. lactis (5%) at similar abundance rates. 5% anthocyanin kefir demonstrated the highest polarity in the community with a strong dominance of probiotic Lb. kefiri (72%), and distinctly less abundant bacteria such as Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (3%). These findings provide that fortification with anthocyanins can be utilized to enhance the quality, composition, and beneficial functions of kefir.
