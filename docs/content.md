Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Microbiome dysbiosis in the mother and infant may contribute to their adverse outcomes. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was performed on all samples. Phyloseq, microbiomeSeq, and NetCoMi were utilized for bioinformatics analysis. Statistical tests included the Wilcoxon test, ANOVA, permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), and linear regression. Statistical significance was set at p value &lt;0.05. The establishment of an infant's microbiome most likely begins in utero and is influenced by the maternal microbiome. Infants' samples were enriched with Salmonella. There is a complex interplay among the microbial taxa noticeable at birth, exhibiting variability in interaction within the same host and across different hosts. Both maternal and infant microbiomes influence the anthropometric measures determined at birth, and a sex-based difference in correlation exists. This study highlights the potential role of maternal and infant microbiomes in improving pregnancy and neonatal outcomes.

Progression of chronic lung disease may lead to the requirement for lung transplant (LTx). Despite improvements in short-term survival after LTx, chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) remains a critical challenge for long-term survival. This study investigates the molecular and microbial relationships between underlying lung disease and the development of CLAD in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from subjects post-LTx, which is crucial for tailoring treatment strategies specific to allograft dysfunctions.

Obesity, and in particular abdominal obesity, is associated with an increased risk of developing a variety of chronic diseases. Obesity, aging, and menopause are each associated with differential shifts in the gut microbiome. Obesity causes chronic low-grade inflammation due to increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels which is termed "metabolic endotoxemia." We examined the association of visceral adiposity tissue (VAT) area, circulating endotoxemia markers, and the gut bacterial microbiome in a cohort of aged postmenopausal women.

## Abundance measurements reveal the balance between lysis and lysogeny in the human gut microbiome.
 10.10.2024, _J Lopez, S McKeithen-Mead, H Shi, TH Nguyen, KC Huang, BH Good_


The human gut contains diverse communities of bacteriophage, whose interactions with the broader microbiome and potential roles in human health are only beginning to be uncovered. Here, we combine multiple types of data to quantitatively estimate gut phage population dynamics and lifestyle characteristics in human subjects. Unifying results from previous studies, we show that an average human gut contains a low ratio of phage particles to bacterial cells (~1:100), but a much larger ratio of phage genomes to bacterial genomes (~4:1), implying that most gut phage are effectively temperate (e.g., integrated prophage, phage-plasmids, etc.). By integrating imaging and sequencing data with a generalized model of temperate phage dynamics, we estimate that phage induction and lysis occurs at a low average rate (~0.001-0.01 per bacterium per day), imposing only a modest fitness burden on their bacterial hosts. Consistent with these estimates, we find that the phage composition of a diverse synthetic community in gnotobiotic mice can be quantitatively predicted from bacterial abundances alone, while still exhibiting phage diversity comparable to native human microbiomes. These results provide a foundation for interpreting existing and future studies on links between the gut virome and human health.

## Failure of colonization following gut microbiota transfer exacerbates DSS-induced colitis.
 10.10.2024, _KL Gustafson, TR Rodriguez, ZL McAdams, LM Coghill, AC Ericsson, CL Franklin_


To study the impact of differing specific pathogen-free gut microbiomes (GMs) on a murine model of inflammatory bowel disease, selected GMs were transferred using embryo transfer (ET), cross-fostering (CF), and co-housing (CH). Prior work showed that the GM transfer method and the microbial composition of donor and recipient GMs can influence microbial colonization and disease phenotypes in dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis. When a low richness GM was transferred to a recipient with a high richness GM via CH, the donor GM failed to successfully colonize, and a more severe disease phenotype resulted when compared to ET or CF, where colonization was successful. By comparing CH and gastric gavage for fecal material transfer, we isolated the microbial component of this effect and determined that differences in disease severity and survival were associated with microbial factors rather than the transfer method itself. Mice receiving a low richness GM via CH and gastric gavage exhibited greater disease severity and higher expression of pro-inflammatory immune mediators compared to those receiving a high richness GM. This study provides valuable insights into the role of GM composition and colonization in disease modulation.

Gut microbiotas have important impacts on host health, reproductive success, and survival. While extensive research in mammals has identified the exogenous (e.g. environment) and endogenous (e.g. phylogeny, sex, and age) factors that shape the gut microbiota composition and functionality, yet avian systems remain comparatively less understood. Shorebirds, characterized by a well-resolved phylogeny and diverse life-history traits, present an ideal model for dissecting the factors modulating gut microbiota dynamics. Here, we provide an insight into the composition of gut microbiota in two high-altitude (ca. 3200 m above sea level) breeding populations of Kentish plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) and Tibetan sand plover (Charadrius altrifrons) in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China. By analysing faecal bacterial communities using 16S rRNA sequencing technology, we find a convergence in gut microbial communities between the two species, dominated by Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. This suggests that the shared breeding environment potentially acts as a significant determinant shaping their gut microbiota. We also show sex- and age-specific patterns of gut microbiota: female adults maintain a higher diversity than males, and juveniles are enriched in Rhizobiaceae and Exiguobacterium due to their vegetative food resource. Our study not only provides a comprehensive descriptive information for future investigations on the diversity, functionality, and determinants of avian microbiomes, but also underscores the importance of microbial communities in broader ecological contexts.

Continuous cropping is a common cultivation practice in lavender cultivation, and the structure of the soil microbial community is one of the main reasons affecting the continuous cropping disorder in lavender; however, the relationship between the number of years of cultivation and inter-root microbial composition has not yet been investigated; using Illumina high-throughput sequencing we detected fungal community structure of rhizosphere soil under 1 (L1), 3 (L3), 5 (L5) and 0 (L0) years' of lavender cultivation in Yili, Xinjiang China. The results showed that with the extension of planting years, the physical-chemical characteristics of the soil shifted, and the diversity of the fungal communities shrank, the abundance and richness of species decreased and then increased, and the phylogenetic diversity increased, The structure of the soil fungal communities varied greatly. At phylum level, dominant fungal phyla were Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes, etc. At genus level, dominant genera were Gibberella, Mortierella, etc, whose absolute abundance all increased with increasing planting years (P &lt; 0.05); redundancy analysis showed that thesoil physicochemical characteristics significantly correlated with dominant bacterial genera. The FUN Guild prediction showed that six groups of plant pathogens and plant saprotrophs changed significantly (P &lt; 0.05), the amount of harmful bacteria in the soil increased while the amount of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungui (AMF) decreased, leading to a continuous cropping obstacle of lavender. The findings of this study provida theoretical foundation for the management of continuous cropping and the prevention fungus-related diseases in lavender.

Escherichia coli sequence type 131 (ST131) is a pandemic clone associated with multidrug-resistant, extraintestinal infections, attributable to the presence of the CTX-M-15 extended-spectrum β-lactamase gene and mutations entailing fluoroquinolone resistance. Studies on subclones within E. coli ST131 are critically required for targeting and implementation of successful control efforts. Our study comprehensively analyzed the genomic and functional attributes of the H30-Rx subclonal strains NA097 and NA114, belonging to the ST131 lineage. We carried out whole-genome sequencing, comparative analysis, phenotypic virulence assays, and profiling of the antibacterial responses of THP1 cells infected with these subclones. Phylogenomic analysis suggested that the strains were clonal in nature and confined entirely to a single clade. Comparative genomic analysis revealed that the virulence and resistance repertoires were comparable among the H30-Rx ST131 strains except for the commensal ST131 strain SE15. Similarly, seven phage-specific regions were found to be strongly associated with the H30-Rx strains but were largely absent in the genome of SE15. Phenotypic analysis confirmed the virulence and resistance similarities between the two strains. However, NA097 was found to be more robust than NA114 in terms of virulence gene carriage (dra operon), invasion ability (P &lt; 0.05), and antimicrobial resistance (streptomycin resistance). RT(2) gene expression profiling revealed generic upregulation of key proinflammatory responses in THP1 cells, irrespective of ST131 lineage status. In conclusion, our study provides comprehensive, genome-inferred insights into the biology and immunological properties of ST131 strains and suggests clonal diversification of genomic and phenotypic features within the H30-Rx subclone of E. coli ST131.

The article presents a processed dataset from amplicon sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene to recover bacterial and archaeal taxa from the caeca of multiple chicken breeds of Pakistan. These include chicken breeds commonly raised at commercial level, Naked Neck, Black Australorp, Rhode Island Red, White Layer, and Broiler. All the breeds were challenged with Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV), with vaccination against the disease also explored. This resulted in samples belonging to four treatment groups as: Control; Vaccinated; Vaccinated and Challenged; and Non-vaccinated and Challenged. These were raised on an antibiotic free diet in a semi-controlled farming setup. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of caecal DNA from day old and mature chicken samples (22 weeks for Naked Neck, Black Australorp, Rhode Island Red and White Layer; 8 weeks for Broiler) of the four groups was performed. The paired-end reads from all the samples were quality trimmed, error corrected, and overlapped, on which unique Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) were obtained at 99 % similarity. Using predictive modelling, the MetaCyc functional pathways, as well as KEGG orthologs were also recovered. The generated data may be used to explore microbial interactions in gastrointestinal tract with respect to NDV vaccination and infection, together with increased understanding of chicken health and productivity.
