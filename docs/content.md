Amino acid auxotrophies are prevalent among bacteria. They can govern ecological dynamics in microbial communities and indicate metabolic cross-feeding interactions among coexisting genotypes. Despite the ecological importance of auxotrophies, their distribution and impact on the diversity and function of the human gut microbiome remain poorly understood. This study performed the first systematic analysis of the distribution of amino acid auxotrophies in the human gut microbiome using a combined metabolomic, metagenomic, and metabolic modeling approach. Results showed that amino acid auxotrophies are ubiquitous in the colon microbiome, with tryptophan auxotrophy being the most common. Auxotrophy frequencies were higher for those amino acids that are also essential to the human host. Moreover, a higher overall abundance of auxotrophies was associated with greater microbiome diversity and stability, and the distribution of auxotrophs was found to be related to the human host's metabolome, including trimethylamine oxide, small aromatic acids, and secondary bile acids. Thus, our results suggest that amino acid auxotrophies are important factors contributing to microbiome ecology and host-microbiome metabolic interactions.

## The global burden of antimicrobial resistance - urinary tract infections.
 27.10.2023, _S Von Vietinghoff, O Shevchuk, U Dobrindt, DR Engel, SK Jorch, C Kurts, T Miethke, F Wagenlehner_


Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) emerged as a significant global healthcare problem. Antibiotic use has accelerated the physiologic process of AMR, particularly in Gram-negative pathogens. Urinary tract infections (UTI) are predominantly of Gram-negative nature. Uropathogens are evolutionarily highly adapted and selected strains with specific virulence factors, suggesting common mechanisms how bacterial cells acquire virulence and AMR factors. The simultaneous increase in resistance and virulence is a complex and context-dependent phenomenon. Amongst known AMR mechanisms, the plenitude of different β-lactamases is especially prominent. The risk for AMR in UTI varies in different patient populations. History of antibiotic consumption and physiology of urinary flow are major factors that shape AMR prevalence. The urinary tract is in close crosstalk with the microbiome of other compartments, such as the gut or the genital tracts. In addition, pharmacokinetic properties and the physiochemical composition of urinary compartments can contribute to emergence of AMR. Alternatives to antibiotic treatment and a broader approach to address bacterial infections are needed. Among the various alternatives studied, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and bacteriophage treatment appear to be highly promising approaches. We here summarize the present knowledge of clinical and microbiological AMR in UTI and discuss innovative approaches, namely new risk prediction tools and the use of non-antibiotic approaches to defend against uropathogenic microbes.

## Microbial-dependent recruitment of immature myeloid cells promotes intestinal regeneration.
 28.10.2023, _Z Jiang, QT Waterbury, E Malagola, N Fu, W Kim, Y Ochiai, F Wu, C Guha, CJ Shawber, KS Yan, TC Wang_


The intestinal epithelium functions both in nutrient absorption and as a barrier, separating the luminal contents from a network of vascular, fibroblastic, and immune cells underneath. Following injury to the intestine, multiple cell populations cooperate to drive regeneration of the mucosal barrier, including lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs). A population of granulocytic immature myeloid cells (IMCs), marked by histidine decarboxylase (Hdc), participate in regeneration of multiple organs such as the colon and central nervous system, but their contribution to intestinal regeneration was unknown.

## Prior antibiotic administration disrupts anti-PD-1 responses in advanced gastric cancer by altering the gut microbiome and systemic immune response.
 27.10.2023, _CG Kim, JY Koh, SJ Shin, JH Shin, M Hong, HC Chung, SY Rha, HS Kim, CK Lee, JH Lee, Y Han, H Kim, X Che, UJ Yun, H Kim, JH Kim, SY Lee, SK Park, S Park, H Kim, JY Ahn, HC Jeung, JS Lee, YD Nam, M Jung_


Evidence on whether prior antibiotic (pATB) administration modulates outcomes of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) inhibitors in advanced gastric cancer (AGC) is scarce. In this study, we find that pATB administration is consistently associated with poor progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in multiple cohorts consisting of patients with AGC treated with PD-1 inhibitors. In contrast, pATB does not affect outcomes among patients treated with irinotecan. Multivariable analysis of the overall patients treated with PD-1 inhibitors confirms that pATB administration independently predicts worse PFS and OS. Administration of pATBs is associated with diminished gut microbiome diversity, reduced abundance of Lactobacillus gasseri, and disproportional enrichment of circulating exhaustive CD8+ T cells, all of which are associated with worse outcomes. Considering the inferior treatment response and poor survival outcomes by pATB administration followed by PD-1 blockade, ATBs should be prescribed with caution in patients with AGC who are planning to receive PD-1 inhibitors.

## Gut microbiome dynamics in index patients colonized with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacterales after hospital discharge and their household contacts.
 27.10.2023, _J Top, TD Verschuuren, MC Viveen, ME Riccio, S Harbarth, JAJW Kluytmans, RJL Willems, FL Paganelli_


This study investigated the gut microbiome dynamics of index patients colonized with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-Ec) (n = 5) or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-Kp) (n = 3) and their household contacts (n = 9) up to 4 months after hospital discharge of the index patient using 16S rRNA amplicon gene sequencing. Samples were collected at the day of hospital discharge of the index patient, 1 week and 2 and 4 months after discharge. Compared to household contacts, we observed a significant lower alpha diversity (P &lt; 0.001) among index patients and significant (P &lt; 0.05) separation between the two groups for beta diversity. Principal component analysis of the samples from each household (i.e., index patient and respective household contact) showed a clear shift in microbiome composition, in 4/8 index patients, from dissimilar to more similar to the household contact group. This suggests recovery of the microbiome to a healthier status, which was also reflected by de novo colonization of (health-associated) taxa. In contrast, the four time-point samples of the household contacts clustered together indicating a stable microbiome composition over time irrespective of low-level ESBL-Ec (n = 3) or ESBL-Kp (n = 2) colonization. In conclusion, here we show that, at the day of hospital discharge, the microbiome composition of index patients is dissimilar from that of household contacts. Over time, signals of microbiome recovery were observed in half of the index patients. The stable microbiome composition in household contacts irrespective of low-level ESBL-Ec or ESBL-Kp colonization suggests that the gut microbiome in these healthy people provided colonization resistance against ESBL-PE outgrowth. IMPORTANCE Colonization with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-PE) often precedes infections and is therefore considered as a great threat for public health. Here, we studied the gut microbiome dynamics in eight index patients colonized with ESBL-PE after hospital discharge and the impact of exposure to this index patient on the gut microbiome dynamics of their household contacts. We showed that the microbiome composition from index patients is different from their household contacts upon hospital discharge and that, in some of the index patients, their microbiome composition over time shifted toward the composition of their household contacts. In contrast, household contacts showed a stable microbiome composition over time irrespective of low-level extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-Ec) or extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-Kp) gut colonization, suggesting that, in healthy microbiomes, colonization resistance is able to prevent ESBL-PE expansion.

## White-nose syndrome restructures bat skin microbiomes.
 27.10.2023, _M Ange-Stark, KL Parise, TL Cheng, JR Hoyt, KE Langwig, WF Frick, AM Kilpatrick, J Gillece, MD MacManes, JT Foster_


The skin microbiome is an essential line of host defense against pathogens, yet our understanding of microbial communities and how they change when hosts become infected is limited. We investigated skin microbial composition in three North American bat species (Myotis lucifugus, Eptesicus fuscus, and Perimyotis subflavus) that have been impacted by the infectious disease, white-nose syndrome, caused by an invasive fungal pathogen, Pseudogymnoascus destructans. We compared bacterial and fungal composition from 154 skin swab samples and 70 environmental samples using a targeted 16S rRNA and internal transcribed spacer amplicon approach. We found that for M. lucifugus, a species that experiences high mortality from white-nose syndrome, bacterial microbiome diversity was dramatically lower when P. destructans was present. Key bacterial families-including those potentially involved in pathogen defense-significantly differed in abundance in bats infected with P. destructans compared to uninfected bats. However, skin bacterial diversity was not lower in E. fuscus or P. subflavus when P. destructans was present despite populations of the latter species declining sharply from white-nose syndrome. The fungal species present on bats substantially overlapped with the fungal taxa present in the environment at the site where the bat was sampled, but fungal community composition was unaffected by the presence of P. destructans for any of the three bat species. This species-specific alteration in bat skin bacterial microbiomes after pathogen invasion may suggest a mechanism for the severity of white-nose syndrome in M. lucifugus but not for other bat species impacted by the disease.IMPORTANCEInherent complexities in the composition of microbiomes can often preclude investigations of microbe-associated diseases. Instead of single organisms being associated with disease, community characteristics may be more relevant. Longitudinal microbiome studies of the same individual bats as pathogens arrive and infect a population are the ideal experiment but remain logistically challenging; therefore, investigations like our approach that are able to correlate invasive pathogens to alterations within a microbiome may be the next best alternative. The results of this study potentially suggest that microbiome-host interactions may determine the likelihood of infection. However, the contrasting relationship between Pd and the bacterial microbiomes of Myotis lucifugus and Perimyotis subflavus indicate that we are just beginning to understand how the bat microbiome interacts with a fungal invader such as Pd.

## Linking Clinical Blood Metabogram and Gut Microbiota.
 29.10.2023, _PG Lokhov, EE Balashova, DL Maslov, OP Trifonova, AV Lisitsa, YM Markova, VV Stetsenko, AS Polyanina, SA Sheveleva, KK Sharafetdinov, DB Nikityuk, VA Tutelyan, AI Archakov_


Recently, a clinical blood metabogram was developed as a fast, low-cost and reproducible test that allows the implementation of metabolomics in clinical practice. The components of the metabogram are functionally related groups of blood metabolites associated with humoral regulation, the metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates and amines, lipid intake into the organism, and liver function, thereby providing clinically relevant information. It is known that the gut microbiota affects the blood metabolome, and the components of the blood metabolome may affect the composition of the gut microbiota. Therefore, before using the metabogram in the clinic, the link between the metabogram components and the level of gut microorganisms should be established. For this purpose, the metabogram and microbiota data were obtained in this work for the same individuals. Metabograms of blood plasma were obtained by direct mass spectrometry of blood plasma, and the gut microbiome was determined by a culture-based method and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This study involved healthy volunteers and individuals with varying degrees of deviation in body weight (n = 44). A correlation analysis determined which metabogram components are linked to which gut microorganisms and the strength of this link. Moreover, diagnostic parameters (sensitivity, specificity and accuracy) confirmed the capacity of metabogram components to be used for diagnosing gut microbiota alterations. Therefore, the obtained results allow the use of the metabogram in a clinical setting, taking into account its relationship with gut microbiota.

Understanding the composition and function of the vaginal microbiome is crucial for reproductive and overall health. Here we established the Isala citizen-science project to analyse the vaginal microbiomes of 3,345 women in Belgium (18-98 years) through self-sampling, 16S amplicon sequencing and extensive questionnaires. The overall vaginal microbiome composition was strongly tied to age, childbirth and menstrual cycle phase. Lactobacillus species dominated 78% of the vaginal samples. Specific bacterial taxa also showed to co-occur in modules based on network correlation analysis. Notably, the module containing Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus jensenii and Limosilactobacillus taxa was positively linked to oestrogen levels and contraceptive use and negatively linked to childbirth and breastfeeding. Other modules, named after abundant taxa (Gardnerella, Prevotella and Bacteroides), correlated with multiple partners, menopause, menstrual hygiene and contraceptive use. With this resource-rich vaginal microbiome map and associated health, life-course, lifestyle and dietary factors, we provide unique data and insights for follow-up clinical and mechanistic research.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease. Ethanol consumption has been reported to reduce morbidity in RA patients, but the mechanism behind it remains unclear. Our results showed that Muribaculaceae was predominant in the gut microbiota of mice after ethanol treatment, and the levels of microbiota metabolite acetate were increased. Acetate reduced arthritis severity in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice, which was associated with a decrease in the articular neutrophils and the myeloperoxidase-deoxyribonucleic acid complex in serum. Meanwhile, in vitro experiments confirmed that acetate affected neutrophil activity by acting on G-protein-coupled receptor 43, which reduced endoplasmic reticulum stress in neutrophils and inhibited neutrophil extracellular traps formation. Furthermore, exogenous acetate reversed CIA mice with exacerbated gut microbial disruption, further confirming that the effect of gut microbial metabolite acetate on neutrophils in vivo is crucial for the immune regulation. Our findings illuminate the metabolic and cellular mechanisms of the gut-joint axis in the regulation of autoimmune arthritis, and may offer alternative avenues to replicate or induce the joint-protective benefits of ethanol without associated detrimental effects.

## Community composition and the environment modulate the population dynamics of type VI secretion in human gut bacteria.
 26.10.2023, _S Robitaille, EL Simmons, AJ Verster, EA McClure, DB Royce, E Trus, K Swartz, D Schultz, CD Nadell, BD Ross_


Understanding the relationship between the composition of the human gut microbiota and the ecological forces shaping it is of great importance; however, knowledge of the biogeographical and ecological relationships between physically interacting taxa is limited. Interbacterial antagonism may play an important role in gut community dynamics, yet the conditions under which antagonistic behaviour is favoured or disfavoured by selection in the gut are not well understood. Here, using genomics, we show that a species-specific type VI secretion system (T6SS) repeatedly acquires inactivating mutations in Bacteroides fragilis in the human gut. This result implies a fitness cost to the T6SS, but we could not identify laboratory conditions under which such a cost manifests. Strikingly, experiments in mice illustrate that the T6SS can be favoured or disfavoured in the gut depending on the strains and species in the surrounding community and their susceptibility to T6SS antagonism. We use ecological modelling to explore the conditions that could underlie these results and find that community spatial structure modulates interaction patterns among bacteria, thereby modulating the costs and benefits of T6SS activity. Our findings point towards new integrative models for interrogating the evolutionary dynamics of type VI secretion and other modes of antagonistic interaction in microbiomes.

Microbial genome recovery from metagenomes can further explain microbial ecosystem structures, functions and dynamics. Thus, this study developed the Additional Clustering Refiner (ACR) to enhance high-purity prokaryotic and eukaryotic metagenome-assembled genome (MAGs) recovery. ACR refines low-quality MAGs by subjecting them to iterative k-means clustering predicated on contig abundance and increasing bin purity through validated universal marker genes. Synthetic and real-world metagenomic datasets, including short- and long-read sequences, evaluated ACR's effectiveness. The results demonstrated improved MAG purity and a significant increase in high- and medium-quality MAG recovery rates. In addition, ACR seamlessly integrates with various binning algorithms, augmenting their strengths without modifying core features. Furthermore, its multiple sequencing technology compatibilities expand its applicability. By efficiently recovering high-quality prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes, ACR is a promising tool for deepening our understanding of microbial communities through genome-centric metagenomics.

## dbAPIS: a database of anti-prokaryotic immune system genes.
 27.10.2023, _Y Yan, J Zheng, X Zhang, Y Yin_


Anti-prokaryotic immune system (APIS) proteins, typically encoded by phages, prophages, and plasmids, inhibit prokaryotic immune systems (e.g. restriction modification, toxin-antitoxin, CRISPR-Cas). A growing number of APIS genes have been characterized and dispersed in the literature. Here we developed dbAPIS (https://bcb.unl.edu/dbAPIS), as the first literature curated data repository for experimentally verified APIS genes and their associated protein families. The key features of dbAPIS include: (i) experimentally verified APIS genes with their protein sequences, functional annotation, PDB or AlphaFold predicted structures, genomic context, sequence and structural homologs from different microbiome/virome databases; (ii) classification of APIS proteins into sequence-based families and construction of hidden Markov models (HMMs); (iii) user-friendly web interface for data browsing by the inhibited immune system types or by the hosts, and functions for searching and batch downloading of pre-computed data; (iv) Inclusion of all types of APIS proteins (except for anti-CRISPRs) that inhibit a variety of prokaryotic defense systems (e.g. RM, TA, CBASS, Thoeris, Gabija). The current release of dbAPIS contains 41 verified APIS proteins and ∼4400 sequence homologs of 92 families and 38 clans. dbAPIS will facilitate the discovery of novel anti-defense genes and genomic islands in phages, by providing a user-friendly data repository and a web resource for an easy homology search against known APIS proteins.

Analysis of microbial data from archaeological samples is a growing field with great potential for understanding ancient environments, lifestyles, and diseases. However, high error rates have been a challenge in ancient metagenomics, and the availability of computational frameworks that meet the demands of the field is limited. Here, we propose aMeta, an accurate metagenomic profiling workflow for ancient DNA designed to minimize the amount of false discoveries and computer memory requirements. Using simulated data, we benchmark aMeta against a current state-of-the-art workflow and demonstrate its superiority in microbial detection and authentication, as well as substantially lower usage of computer memory.
