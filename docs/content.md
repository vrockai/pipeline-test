The human microbiome has recently become a valuable source of information about host life and health. To date little is known about how it may have evolved during key phases along our history, such as the Neolithic transition towards agriculture. Here, we shed light on the evolution experienced by the oral microbiome during this transition, comparing Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers with Neolithic and Copper Age farmers that populated a same restricted area in Italy. We integrate the analysis of 76 dental calculus oral microbiomes with the dietary information derived from the identification of embedded plant remains. We detect a stronger deviation from the hunter-gatherer microbiome composition in the last part of the Neolithic, while to a lesser extent in the early phases of the transition. Our findings demonstrate that the introduction of agriculture affected host microbiome, supporting the hypothesis of a gradual transition within the investigated populations.

## Maternal obesity and resistance to breast cancer treatments among offspring: Link to gut dysbiosis.
 22.11.2022, _F de Oliveira Andrade, V Verma, L Hilakivi-Clarke_


About 50 000 new cases of cancer in the United States are attributed to obesity. The adverse effects of obesity on breast cancer may be most profound when affecting the early development; that is, in the womb of a pregnant obese mother. Maternal obesity has several long-lasting adverse health effects on the offspring, including increasing offspring's breast cancer risk and mortality. Gut microbiota is a player in obesity as well as may impact breast carcinogenesis. Gut microbiota is established early in life and the microbial composition of an infant's gut becomes permanently dysregulated because of maternal obesity. Metabolites from the microbiota, especially short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), play a critical role in mediating the effect of gut bacteria on multiple biological functions, such as immune system, including tumor immune responses.

With increasing urbanization and industrialization, the prevalence of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) has steadily been rising over the past two decades. IBD involves flares of gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation accompanied by microbiota perturbations. However, microbial mechanisms that trigger such flares remain elusive. Here, we analyzed the association of the emerging pathogen atypical enteropathogenic E. coli (aEPEC) with IBD disease activity. The presence of diarrheagenic E. coli was assessed in stool samples from 630 IBD patients and 234 age- and sex-matched controls without GI symptoms. Microbiota was analyzed with 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing, and 57 clinical aEPEC isolates were subjected to whole-genome sequencing and in vitro pathogenicity experiments including biofilm formation, epithelial barrier function and the ability to induce pro-inflammatory signaling. The presence of aEPEC correlated with laboratory, clinical and endoscopic disease activity in ulcerative colitis (UC), as well as microbiota dysbiosis. In vitro, aEPEC strains induce epithelial p21-activated kinases, disrupt the epithelial barrier and display potent biofilm formation. The effector proteins espV and espG2 distinguish aEPEC cultured from UC and Crohn's disease patients, respectively. EspV-positive aEPEC harbor more virulence factors and have a higher pro-inflammatory potential, which is counteracted by 5-ASA. aEPEC may tip a fragile immune-microbiota homeostasis and thereby contribute to flares in UC. aEPEC isolates from UC patients display properties to disrupt the epithelial barrier and to induce pro-inflammatory signaling in vitro.

## Impact of antibiotic perturbation on fecal viral communities in mice.
 22.11.2022, _JM Anderson, T Lachnit, S Lipinski, M Falk-Paulsen, P Rosenstiel_


Viruses and bacteriophages have a strong impact on intestinal barrier function and the composition and functional properties of commensal bacterial communities. Shifts of the fecal virome might be involved in human diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Loss-of-function variants in the NOD2 gene are associated with an increased risk of developing Crohn's disease, a subtype of human chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), where specific changes in fecal viral communities have also been described. To improve our understanding of the dynamics of the enteric virome, we longitudinally characterized the virome in fecal samples from wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 knock-out (NOD2 KO) mice in response to an antibiotic perturbation. Sequencing of virus-like-particles (VLPs) demonstrated both a high diversity and high inter-individual variation of the murine fecal virome composed of eukaryotic viruses and bacteriophages. Antibiotics had a significant impact on the fecal murine virome. Viral community composition only partially recovered in the observation period (10 weeks after cessation of antibiotics) irrespective of genotype. However, compositional shifts in the virome and bacteriome were highly correlated, suggesting that the loss of specific phages may contribute to prolonged dysregulation of the bacterial community composition. We suggest that therapeutic interference with the fecal virome may represent a novel approach in microbiota-targeted therapies.

## Assessing Fungal Diversity and Abundance in the Black Soldier Fly and its Environment.
 22.11.2022, _T Vitenberg, I Opatovsky_


_Animals, Diptera, Larva, Gastrointestinal Microbiome_
Detritivorous insects that flourish in decaying environments encounter microorganisms throughout their life cycle. However, it is not clear whether the microbial composition of the decaying environment affects the microbial composition of the insect gut, or whether the opposite is true, with the microorganisms that are adapted to the insect's digestive system being dispersed by the insects to new habitats, thereby becoming more and more common in the environment. To test these questions the fungal composition of the black soldier fly (BSF) (Stratiomyidae; Hermetia illucens Linnaeus) larval gut and its surrounding decaying environment (household compost bins) were analyzed using amplicon sequencing. Constancy in the dominance of the genus Candida (Debaryomycetaceae) in most of the environments and larval guts was found. This finding may suggest a 'core' structure to the fungal community of the BSF. In locations where nutrient composition of the environment had higher fiber content, the Candida was not dominant and the most common fungi were the genus Gibberella (Nectriaceae) and the family Dipodascaceae. The later was dominant also in the larval gut and the former was replaced with Meyerozyma (Debaryomycetaceae), which may suggest a selection process by the insect's gut. Little is known about the ecological interactions of insects with eukaryotic microorganisms, such as yeast-like fungi. As their metabolic complexity and ability is intense, they have the potential to dramatically affect the physiological condition of the insect.

## Bacterial communities vary across populations and tissue type in red mangroves (Rhizophora mangle, Rhizophoraceae) along an expanding front.
 22.11.2022, _BP Scherer, OU Mason, AR Mast_


Plant-associated microbial communities may be important sources of functional diversity and genetic variation that influence host evolution. Bacteria provide benefits for their hosts, yet in most plant systems we know little about their taxonomic composition or variation across tissues and host range. Red Mangrove (Rhizophora mangle L.) is a vital coastal plant species that is currently expanding poleward and with it, perhaps, its microbiome. We explored variability in bacterial communities across tissues, individuals, and populations. We collected samples from six sample types from 5-10 individuals at each of 3 populations and used 16S rRNA gene (iTag) sequencing to describe their bacterial communities. Core community members and dominant bacterial classes were determined for each sample type. Pairwise PERMANOVA of Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and Indicator Species Analysis revealed significant differences in bacterial communities between sample types and populations. We described the previously unexplored microbiome of the reproductive tissues of R. mangle. Populations and most sample types were associated with distinct communities. Bacterial communities associated with R. mangle are influenced by host geography and sample type. Our study provides a foundation for future work exploring the functional roles of these microbes and their relevance to biogeochemical cycling.
