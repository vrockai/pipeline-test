## Host-microbiome interactions: the aryl hydrocarbon receptor as a critical node in tryptophan metabolites to brain signaling.
 13.05.2020, _N Ma, T He, LJ Johnston, X Ma_


Tryptophan (Trp) is not only a nutrient enhancer but also has systemic effects. Trp metabolites signaling through the well-known aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) constitute the interface of microbiome-gut-brain axis. However, the pathway through which Trp metabolites affect central nervous system (CNS) function have not been fully elucidated. AhR participates in a broad variety of physiological and pathological processes that also highly relevant to intestinal homeostasis and CNS diseases. Via the AhR-dependent mechanism, Trp metabolites connect bidirectional signaling between the gut microbiome and the brain, mediated via immune, metabolic, and neural (vagal) signaling mechanisms, with downstream effects on behavior and CNS function. These findings shed light on the complex Trp regulation of microbiome-gut-brain axis and add another facet to our understanding that dietary Trp is expected to be a promising noninvasive approach for alleviating systemic diseases.

## Visualizing the invisible: class excursions to ignite children's enthusiasm for microbes.
 16.05.2020, _TJ McGenity, A Gessesse, JE Hallsworth, E Garcia Cela, C Verheecke-Vaessen, F Wang, M Chavarría, MM Haggblom, S Molin, A Danchin, EJ Smid, C Lood, CS Cockell, C Whitby, SJ Liu, NP Keller, LY Stein, SR Bordenstein, R Lal, OC Nunes, L Gram, BK Singh, NS Webster, C Morris, S Sivinski, S Bindschedler, P Junier, A Antunes, BK Baxter, P Scavone, K Timmis_


We have recently argued that, because microbes have pervasive - often vital - influences on our lives, and that therefore their roles must be taken into account in many of the decisions we face, society must become microbiology-literate, through the introduction of relevant microbiology topics in school curricula (Timmis et al. 2019. Environ Microbiol 21: 1513-1528). The current coronavirus pandemic is a stark example of why microbiology literacy is such a crucial enabler of informed policy decisions, particularly those involving preparedness of public-health systems for disease outbreaks and pandemics. However, a significant barrier to attaining widespread appreciation of microbial contributions to our well-being and that of the planet is the fact that microbes are seldom visible: most people are only peripherally aware of them, except when they fall ill with an infection. And it is disease, rather than all of the positive activities mediated by microbes, that colours public perception of 'germs' and endows them with their poor image. It is imperative to render microbes visible, to give them life and form for children (and adults), and to counter prevalent misconceptions, through exposure to imagination-capturing images of microbes and examples of their beneficial outputs, accompanied by a balanced narrative. This will engender automatic mental associations between everyday information inputs, as well as visual, olfactory and tactile experiences, on the one hand, and the responsible microbes/microbial communities, on the other hand. Such associations, in turn, will promote awareness of microbes and of the many positive and vital consequences of their actions, and facilitate and encourage incorporation of such consequences into relevant decision-making processes. While teaching microbiology topics in primary and secondary school is key to this objective, a strategic programme to expose children directly and personally to natural and managed microbial processes, and the results of their actions, through carefully planned class excursions to local venues, can be instrumental in bringing microbes to life for children and, collaterally, their families. In order to encourage the embedding of microbiology-centric class excursions in current curricula, we suggest and illustrate here some possibilities relating to the topics of food (a favourite pre-occupation of most children), agriculture (together with horticulture and aquaculture), health and medicine, the environment and biotechnology. And, although not all of the microbially relevant infrastructure will be within reach of schools, there is usually access to a market, local food store, wastewater treatment plant, farm, surface water body, etc., all of which can provide opportunities to explore microbiology in action. If children sometimes consider the present to be mundane, even boring, they are usually excited with both the past and the future so, where possible, visits to local museums (the past) and research institutions advancing knowledge frontiers (the future) are strongly recommended, as is a tapping into the natural enthusiasm of local researchers to leverage the educational value of excursions and virtual excursions. Children are also fascinated by the unknown, so, paradoxically, the invisibility of microbes makes them especially fascinating objects for visualization and exploration. In outlining some of the options for microbiology excursions, providing suggestions for discussion topics and considering their educational value, we strive to extend the vistas of current class excursions and to: (i) inspire teachers and school managers to incorporate more microbiology excursions into curricula; (ii) encourage microbiologists to support school excursions and generally get involved in bringing microbes to life for children; (iii) urge leaders of organizations (biopharma, food industries, universities, etc.) to give school outreach activities a more prominent place in their mission portfolios, and (iv) convey to policymakers the benefits of providing schools with funds, materials and flexibility for educational endeavours beyond the classroom.

## Multi-omics reveals that the rumen microbiome and its metabolome together with the host metabolome contribute to individualized dairy cow performance.
 19.05.2020, _MY Xue, HZ Sun, XH Wu, JX Liu, LL Guan_


Recently, we reported that some dairy cows could produce high amounts of milk with high amounts of protein (defined as milk protein yield [MPY]) when a population was raised under the same nutritional and management condition, a potential new trait that can be used to increase high-quality milk production. It is unknown to what extent the rumen microbiome and its metabolites, as well as the host metabolism, contribute to MPY. Here, analysis of rumen metagenomics and metabolomics, together with serum metabolomics was performed to identify potential regulatory mechanisms of MPY at both the rumen microbiome and host levels.

## Longitudinal Study of Oral Microbiome Variation in Twins.

Humans are host to a multitude of microorganisms that rapidly populate the body at birth, subject to a complex interplay that is dependent on host genetics, lifestyle, and environment. The host-associated microbiome, including the oral microbiome, presents itself in a complex ecosystem important to health and disease. As the most common chronic disease globally, dental caries is induced by host-microbial dysbiosis in children and adults. Multiple biological and environmental factors are likely to impact disease predisposition, onset, progression, and severity, yet longitudinal studies able to capture these influences are missing. To investigate how host genetics and environment influenced the oral microbial communities over time, we profiled supragingival plaque microbiomes of dizygotic and monozygotic twins during 3 visits over 12-months. Dental plaque DNA samples were amplified by targeting the 16S rRNA gene V4 region, and microbial findings were correlated with clinical, diet and genetic metadata. We observed that the oral microbiome variances were shaped primarily by the environment when compared to host genetics. Among the environmental factors shaping microbial changes of our subjects, significant metadata included age of the subject, and the age by which subjects initiated brushing habits, and the types of actions post-brushing. Relevant heritability of the microbiome included Actinomyces and Capnocytophaga in monozygotic twins and Kingella in dizygotic twins. Corynebacterium and Veillonella abundances were associated with age, whereas Aggregatibacter was associated with younger subjects. Streptococcus abundance showed an inverse association over time, and Selenomonas abundances increased with brushing frequency per day. Unraveling the exact biological mechanisms in caries has the potential to reveal novel host-microbial biomarkers, pathways, and targets important to effective preventive measures, and early disease control in children.

## Antimicrobial peptide GH12 prevents dental caries by regulating dental plaque microbiota.
 16.05.2020, _W Jiang, Y Wang, J Luo, X Chen, Y Zeng, X Li, Z Feng, L Zhang_


Due to the complex microecology and microenvironment of dental plaque, novel caries prevention strategies require modulating the microbial communities ecologically and reducing the cariogenic properties effectively. Antimicrobial peptide GH12 reduced the lactic acid production and exopolysaccharides (EPS) synthesis of the Streptococcus mutans biofilm and the three-species biofilm in vitro in the previous studies. However, the anticaries effects and microecological effects of GH12 remained to be investigated in the complex biofilm model in vitro and the animal caries model in vivo In the present study, GH12 at 64 mg/mL showed the most effective inhibition on lactic acid production, EPS synthesis, pH decline and biofilm integrity of the human dental plaque-derived multispecies biofilms in vitro, and GH12 at 64 mg/L was therefore chosen for subsequent assays in vitro and in vivo When treated with 64 mg/L GH12, the dental plaque-derived multispecies biofilms sampled from the healthy volunteers maintained the microbial diversity and showed a similar microbial community structure to the control group. In the rat caries model with a caries-promoting diet, 64 mg/L GH12 regulated the microbiota of dental plaque, where the abundance of caries-associated bacteria was decreased and the abundance of commensal bacteria was increased. In addition, 64 mg/L GH12 significantly reduced the caries scores of sulcal and smooth surface caries in all locations. In conclusion, GH12 could inhibit the cariogenic properties of dental plaque without perturbing the dental plaque microbiota of healthy individuals, and GH12 could regulate the dysbiotic microbial ecology and arrest caries development under cariogenic conditions.Importance The anticaries effects and microecological regulation effects of antimicrobial peptide GH12 were evaluated systematically in vitro and in vivo GH12 inhibited the cariogenic virulence of dental plaque without over-intervening in the microbial ecology of healthy individuals in vitro GH12 regulated the microbial ecology of dental plaque to a certain extent in vivo under cariogenic conditions, increased the proportion of commensal bacteria, and decreased the abundance of caries-associated bacteria. GH12 could significantly suppress the incidence and severity of dental caries in vivo This study provided an alternative antimicrobial therapy for the treatment of dental caries.

## Rotavirus infection induces glycan availability to promote ileum-specific changes in the microbiome aiding rotavirus virulence.
 14.05.2020, _MA Engevik, LD Banks, KA Engevik, AL Chang-Graham, JL Perry, DS Hutchinson, NJ Ajami, JF Petrosino, JM Hyser_


Multiple studies have identified changes within the gut microbiome in response to diarrheal-inducing bacterial pathogens. However, examination of the microbiome in response to viral pathogens remains understudied. Compounding this, many studies use fecal samples to assess microbiome composition; which may not accurately mirror changes within the small intestine, the primary site for most enteric virus infections. As a result, the functional significance of small intestinal microbiome shifts during infection is not well defined. To address these gaps, rotavirus-infected neonatal mice were examined for changes in bacterial community dynamics, host gene expression, and tissue recovery during infection. Profiling bacterial communities using 16S rRNA sequencing suggested significant and distinct changes in ileal communities in response to rotavirus infection, with no significant changes for other gastrointestinal (GI) compartments. At 1-d post-infection, we observed a loss in Lactobacillus species from the ileum, but an increase in Bacteroides and Akkermansia, both of which exhibit mucin-digesting capabilities. Concomitant with the bacterial community shifts, we observed a loss of mucin-filled goblet cells in the small intestine at d 1, with recovery occurring by d 3. Rotavirus infection of mucin-producing cell lines and human intestinal enteroids (HIEs) stimulated release of stored mucin granules, similar to in vivo findings. In vitro, incubation of mucins with Bacteroides or Akkermansia members resulted in significant glycan degradation, which altered the binding capacity of rotavirus in silico and in vitro. Taken together, these data suggest that the response to and recovery from rotavirus-diarrhea is unique between sub-compartments of the GI tract and may be influenced by mucin-degrading microbes.

## Improved viability of Akkermansia muciniphila by encapsulation in spray dried succinate-grafted alginate doped with epigallocatechin-3-gallate.
 18.05.2020, _Y Chang, Y Yang, N Xu, H Mu, H Zhang, J Duan_


We explored the possibility of improving the viability of Akkermansia muciniphila by encapsulating it in succinate-grafted alginate doped with epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). In this study, the determined surface properties of microcapsules and modified materials and the measured viability of probiotics after spray drying showed that the modified sodium alginate made the surfaces of microcapsules smoother and denser during the spray drying, thus preventing damages. EGCG enhanced the antioxidant capacity of probiotics by filling the pores inside microgels. Moreover, we analyzed the long-term storage vitality changes, oxidation resistance, uniformity, particle size and Zeta potential of microcapsules and found that spray-dried modified sodium alginate microcapsules with EGCG showed the better storability and stability. In addition, we experimentally analyzed the resistances of different microcapsules to the gastrointestinal fluid and found that EGCG-modified sodium alginate microcapsules better protected the probiotic activity from gastrointestinal fluid. This study provides a slimming product with industrial application potential.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), is composed of eight subspecies. TB in West Africa, in contrast to other geographical regions, is caused by Mycobacterium africanum (MAF) in addition to M. tuberculosis (MTB), with both infections presenting similar symptoms. Nevertheless, MAF is considered to be hypovirulent in comparison with MTB and less likely to progress to active disease. In this study, we asked whether MAF and MTB infected patients possess distinct intestinal microbiomes and characterized how these microbiota communities are affected by anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT). Additionally, we assessed if the changes in microbiota composition following infection correlate with pathogen induced alterations in host blood-gene expression.

## Sphingolipids produced by gut bacteria enter host metabolic pathways impacting ceramide levels.
 19.05.2020, _EL Johnson, SL Heaver, JL Waters, BI Kim, A Bretin, AL Goodman, AT Gewirtz, TS Worgall, RE Ley_


Gut microbes are linked to host metabolism, but specific mechanisms remain to be uncovered. Ceramides, a type of sphingolipid (SL), have been implicated in the development of a range of metabolic disorders from insulin resistance (IR) to hepatic steatosis. SLs are obtained from the diet and generated by de novo synthesis in mammalian tissues. Another potential, but unexplored, source of mammalian SLs is production by Bacteroidetes, the dominant phylum of the gut microbiome. Genomes of Bacteroides spp. and their relatives encode serine palmitoyltransfease (SPT), allowing them to produce SLs. Here, we explore the contribution of SL-production by gut Bacteroides to host SL homeostasis. In human cell culture, bacterial SLs are processed by host SL-metabolic pathways. In mouse models, Bacteroides-derived lipids transfer to host epithelial tissue and the hepatic portal vein. Administration of B. thetaiotaomicron to mice, but not an SPT-deficient strain, reduces de novo SL production and increases liver ceramides. These results indicate that gut-derived bacterial SLs affect host lipid metabolism.

## The Links Between the Gut Microbiome, Aging, Modern Lifestyle and Alzheimer's Disease.
 09.04.2020, _S Askarova, B Umbayev, AR Masoud, A Kaiyrlykyzy, Y Safarova, A Tsoy, F Olzhayev, A Kushugulova_


Gut microbiome is a community of microorganisms in the gastrointestinal tract. These bacteria have a tremendous impact on the human physiology in healthy individuals and during an illness. Intestinal microbiome can influence one's health either directly by secreting biologically active substances such as vitamins, essential amino acids, lipids et cetera or indirectly by modulating metabolic processes and the immune system. In recent years considerable information has been accumulated on the relationship between gut microbiome and brain functions. Moreover, significant quantitative and qualitative changes of gut microbiome have been reported in patients with Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, gut microbiome is highly sensitive to negative external lifestyle aspects, such as diet, sleep deprivation, circadian rhythm disturbance, chronic noise, and sedentary behavior, which are also considered as important risk factors for the development of sporadic Alzheimer's disease. In this regard, this review is focused on analyzing the links between gut microbiome, modern lifestyle, aging, and Alzheimer's disease.
