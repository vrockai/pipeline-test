## Bioinformatic mining for RiPP biosynthetic gene clusters in Bacteroidales reveals possible new subfamily architectures and novel natural products.
 21.07.2023, _MV Fernandez-Cantos, D Garcia-Morena, Y Yi, L Liang, E Gómez-Vázquez, OP Kuipers_


The Bacteroidales order, widely distributed among diverse human populations, constitutes a key component of the human microbiota. Members of this Gram-negative order have been shown to modulate the host immune system, play a fundamental role in the gut's microbial food webs, or be involved in pathogenesis. Bacteria inhabiting such a complex environment as the human microbiome are expected to display social behaviors and, hence, possess factors that mediate cooperative and competitive interactions. Different types of molecules can mediate interference competition, including non-ribosomal peptides (NRPs), polyketides, and bacteriocins. The present study investigates the potential of Bacteroidales bacteria to biosynthesize class I bacteriocins, which are ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). For this purpose, 1,136 genome-sequenced strains from this order were mined using BAGEL4. A total of 1,340 areas of interest (AOIs) were detected. The most commonly identified enzymes involved in RiPP biosynthesis were radical S-adenosylmethionine (rSAM), either alone or in combination with other biosynthetic enzymes such as YcaO. A more comprehensive analysis of a subset of 9 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) revealed a consistent association in Bacteroidales BGCs between peptidase-containing ATP-binding transporters (PCATs) and precursor peptides with GG-motifs. This finding suggests a possibly shared mechanism for leader peptide cleavage and transport of mature products. Notably, human metagenomic studies showed a high prevalence and abundance of the RiPP BGCs from Phocaeicola vulgatus and Porphyromonas gulae. The mature product of P. gulae BGC is hypothesized to display γ-thioether linkages and a C-terminal backbone amidine, a potential new combination of post-translational modifications (PTM). All these findings highlight the RiPP biosynthetic potential of Bacteroidales bacteria, as a rich source of novel peptide structures of possible relevance in the human microbiome context.

## A bioinformatic analysis of zinc transporters in intestinal Lactobacillaceae.
 18.07.2023, _U Huynh, HN Nguyen, BK Trinh, J Elhaj, ML Zastrow_


As the second most abundant transition element and a crucial cofactor for many proteins, zinc is essential for the survival of all living organisms. To maintain required zinc levels and prevent toxic overload, cells and organisms have a collection of metal transport proteins for uptake and efflux of zinc. In bacteria, metal transport proteins are well defined for model organisms and many pathogens, but fewer studies have explored metal transport proteins, including those for zinc, in commensal bacteria from the gut microbiota. The healthy human gut microbiota is comprised of hundreds of species and among these, bacteria from the Lactobacillaceae family are well documented to have various beneficial effects on health. Furthermore, changes in dietary metal intake, such as for zinc and iron, are frequently correlated with changes in abundance of Lactobacillaceae. Few studies have explored zinc requirements and zinc homeostasis mechanisms in Lactobacillaceae, however. Here we applied a bioinformatics approach to identify and compare predicted zinc uptake and efflux proteins in several Lactobacillaceae genera of intestinal relevance. Few Lactobacillaceae had zinc transporters currently annotated in proteomes retrieved from the UniProt database, but protein sequence-based (BLASTP) homology searches revealed that high affinity ABC transporter genes are likely common, albeit with genus-specific domain features. P-type ATPase transporters are probably also common and some Lactobacillaceae genera code for predicted zinc efflux cation diffusion facilitators. This analysis confirms that Lactobacillaceae harbor genes for various zinc transporter homologs, and provides a foundation for systematic experimental studies to elucidate zinc homeostasis mechanisms in these bacteria.

## Uncovering the Carboxylated Metabolome in Gut Microbiota-Host Co-metabolism: A Chemical Derivatization-Molecular Networking Approach.
 20.07.2023, _YZ Wang, YY Chen, XZ Wu, PR Bai, N An, XL Liu, QF Zhu, YQ Feng_


Gut microbiota-host co-metabolites serve as essential mediators of communication between the host and gut microbiota. They provide nutrient sources for host cells and regulate gut microenvironment, which are associated with a variety of diseases. Analysis of gut microbiota-host co-metabolites is of great significance to explore the host-gut microbiota interaction. In this study, we integrated chemical derivatization, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and molecular networking (MN) to establish a novel CD-MN strategy for the analysis of carboxylated metabolites in gut microbial-host co-metabolism. Using this strategy, 261 carboxylated metabolites from mouse feces were detected, which grouped to various classes including fatty acids, bile acids, N-acyl amino acids, benzoheterocyclic acids, aromatic acids, and other unknown small-scale molecular clusters in MN. Based on the interpretation of the bile acid cluster, a novel type of phenylacetylated conjugates of host bile acids was identified, which were mediated by gut microbiota and exhibited a strong binding ability to Farnesoid X receptor and Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5. Our proposed strategy offers a promising platform for uncovering carboxylated metabolites in gut microbial-host co-metabolism.
