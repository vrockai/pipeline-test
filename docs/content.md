Childhood is considered crucial in the establishment of future oral microbiota. However, the precise period of oral microbiota development remains unclear. This study aimed to identify the progression of oral microbiota formation in children. We longitudinally investigated the salivary microbiota of 54 children across 13 time points from 1 wk to 60 mo (5 y) old and their parents at 2 time points as a representative sample of the adult microbiota. Using next-generation sequencing, we obtained 10,000 gene sequences of the 16s rRNA V1-V2 region for each sample. The detection rate in children of 110 operational taxonomic units commonly detected in more than 85% of mothers and fathers, defined as the main constituent bacteria, was 25% at 1 wk old, increased to 80% between 6 and 18 mo old, and reached approximately 90% by 36 mo old. Early main constituent bacteria detected at 1 wk old were limited to Streptococcus, Rothia, and Gemella. At 6 to 18 mo old, the detection rates of various main constituent bacteria, including Neisseria, Haemophilus, and Fusobacterium, increased. UniFrac distance analysis showed that the oral microbiota of children approached that of adults at 6 to 18 mo old. In the weighted UniFrac distance index, unlike the unweighted index, there were no significant changes in children between 36 and 60 mo old from adults, and microbiota formation at 60 mo old was sufficiently advanced to be included within the range of adult individual differences. Our findings suggest that the initial 36 mo, particularly the period from 6 to 18 mo old, consists of a time window for oral microbiota maturation. In addition, the development of microbiota during this period may be critical for future oral disease prevention.

Pre-diagnostic disturbances in the microbiome-derived metabolome have been associated with an increased risk of diabetes in non-pregnant populations. However, the roles of microbiome-derived metabolites, the end-products of microbial metabolism, in gestational diabetes (GDM) remain understudied. We examined the prospective association of microbiome-derived metabolites in early to mid-pregnancy with GDM risk in a diverse population.

Fecal samples were collected from 640 individuals in Korea, including 523 patients with IBD (223 with Crohn's disease [CD] and 300 with ulcerative colitis [UC]) and 117 healthy controls. The samples were subjected to cross-sectional gut metagenomic analysis using 16 S rRNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. Patients with IBD, particularly those with CD, exhibited significantly lower alpha diversities than the healthy subjects. Differential abundance analysis revealed dysbiotic signatures, characterized by an expansion of the genus Escherichia-Shigella in patients with CD. Functional annotations showed that functional pathways related to bacterial pathogenesis and production of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) were strongly upregulated in patients with CD. A dysbiosis score, calculated based on functional characteristics, highly correlated with disease severity. Markers distinguishing between healthy subjects and patients with IBD showed accurate classification based on a small number of microbial taxa, which may be used to diagnose ambiguous cases. These findings confirm the taxonomic and functional dysbiosis of the gut microbiota in patients with IBD, especially those with CD. Taxa indicative of dysbiosis may have significant implications for future clinical research on the management and diagnosis of IBD.

## Balancing act: counteracting adverse drug effects on the microbiome.
 12.10.2024, _J de la Cuesta-Zuluaga, P Müller, L Maier_


The human gut microbiome, a community of microbes that plays a crucial role in our wellbeing, is highly adaptable but also vulnerable to drug treatments. This vulnerability can have serious consequences for the host, for example, increasing susceptibility to infections, immune, metabolic, and cognitive disorders. However, the microbiome's adaptability also provides opportunities to prevent, protect, or even reverse drug-induced damage. Recently, several innovative approaches have emerged aimed at minimizing the collateral damage of drugs on the microbiome. Here, we outline these approaches, discuss their applicability in different treatment scenarios, highlight current challenges, and suggest avenues that may lead to an effective protection of the microbiome.

_Humans, Female, Genital Neoplasms, Female, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Dysbiosis, Mouth, Microbiota_
Gynecologic cancers develop from the female reproductive organs. Microbial dysbiosis in the gut and oral cavity can communicate with each other through various ways, leading to mucosal destruction, inflammatory response, genomic instability, and ultimately inducing cancer and worsening. Here, we introduce the mechanisms of interactions between gut and oral microbiota and their changes in the development of gynecologic tumors. In addition, new therapeutic approaches based on microbiota modulation are discussed.

## Effects of complex probiotics on intestinal function and its regulatory mechanism in patients with constipation.
 10.10.2024, _X Zhang, Y Jia, X Li, X Wang, L Li, P Zhang, X Dong, X Ze, Y An, J Li_


Chronic constipation is a multi-symptomatic, multifactorial, and heterogeneous gastrointestinal disorder. Current pharmacological treatments for chronic constipation are limited and might negatively impact the patients' quality of life. Although probiotics have been shown to improve constipation symptoms, their specific regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. This study sought to explore how probiotic complexes may affect chronic constipation by improving patients' defecation habits. Furthermore, microbial profiles and non-targeted metabolites were assessed to explore the metabolic pathways involved in the improvement of constipation by probiotics. Patients with chronic constipation were treated using a single-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial design. The experimental group was administered Lactobacillus powder prepared from 15 probiotic products, and maltodextrin was used as a placebo. Samples were collected twice daily for 4 weeks, and faecal samples were analysed using 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolic histology. Probiotic treatment changed the makeup of the gut microbiota, enhanced the quantity of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus, and markedly reduced clinical symptoms. The 16S rRNA analysis revealed that the abundance of Bifidobacterium and Prevotella increased while that of Thickettsia declined. Moreover, there was a decrease in the abundance of Faecalibacterium and Roseburia. Non-targeted metabolomics analysis identified several differential metabolites, including succinic acid, fumaric acid, cholesterol, xanthurenic acid, 3-alpha,7-alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-oic, and N-methyltryptamine. KEGG analysis showed that these metabolites were mainly associated with metabolic pathways such as primary bile acid biosynthesis, tryptophan metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, cholesterol metabolism, and propanoate metabolism. In this study, gut microbiome and non-targeted metabolome analyses were performed on collected faecal samples to compare characteristic microorganisms and differential metabolites to provide new insights and references for probiotic intervention in constipation.

## Microbiome-based therapeutics for Parkinson's disease.
 11.10.2024, _AM Hamilton, IN Krout, AC White, TR Sampson_


Recent experimental and clinical data demonstrate a significant dysregulation of the gut microbiome in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). With an immense influence on all aspects of physiology, this dysregulation has potential to directly or indirectly contribute to disease pathology. Experimental models have bridged these associations toward defined contributions, identifying various microbiome-dependent impacts to PD pathology. These studies have laid the foundation for human translation, examining whether certain members of the microbiome and/or whole restoration of the gut microbiome community can provide therapeutic benefit for people living with PD. Here, we review recent and ongoing clinically-focused studies that use microbiome-targeted therapies to limit the severity and progression of PD. Fecal microbiome transplants, prebiotic interventions, and probiotic supplementation are each emerging as viable methodologies to augment the gut microbiome and potentially limit PD symptoms. While still early, the data in the field to date support continued cross-talk between experimental systems and human studies to identify key microbial factors that contribute to PD pathologies.

## Gut bacteria of lepidopteran herbivores facilitate digestion of plant toxins.

Lepidopterans commonly feed on plant material, being the most significant insect herbivores in nature. Despite plant resistance to herbivory, such as producing toxic secondary metabolites, herbivores have developed mechanisms encoded in their genomes to tolerate or detoxify plant defensive compounds. Recent studies also highlight the role of gut microbiota in mediating detoxification in herbivores; however, convincing evidence supporting the significant contribution of gut symbionts is rare in Lepidoptera. Here, we show that the growth of various lepidopteran species was inhibited by a mulberry-derived secondary metabolite, 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ); as expected, the specialist silkworm Bombyx mori grew well, but interestingly, gut microbiota of early-instar silkworms was affected by the DNJ level, and several bacterial species responded positively to enriched DNJ. Among these, a bacterial strain isolated from the silkworm gut (Pseudomonas fulva ZJU1) can degrade and utilize DNJ as the sole energy source, and after inoculation into nonspecialists (e.g., beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua), P. fulva ZJU1 increased host resistance to DNJ and significantly promoted growth. We used genomic and transcriptomic analyses to identify genes potentially involved in DNJ degradation, and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated mutagenesis verified the function of ilvB, a key binding protein, in metabolizing DNJ. Furthermore, the ilvB deletion mutant, exhibiting normal bacterial growth, could no longer enhance nonspecialist performance, supporting a role in DNJ degradation in vivo. Therefore, our study demonstrated causality between the gut microbiome and detoxification of plant chemical defense in Lepidoptera, facilitating a mechanistic understanding of host-microbe relationships across this complex, abundant insect group.

## Comprehensive profile of the companion animal gut microbiome integrating reference-based and reference-free methods.

The gut microbiome of companion animals is relatively underexplored, despite its relevance to animal health, pet owner health, and basic microbial community biology. Here, we provide the most comprehensive analysis of the canine and feline gut microbiomes to date, incorporating 2639 stool shotgun metagenomes (2272 dog and 367 cat) spanning 14 publicly available datasets (n = 730) and 8 new study populations (n = 1909). These are compared with 238 and 112 baseline human gut metagenomes from the Human Microbiome Project 1-II and a traditionally living Malagasy cohort, respectively, processed in a manner identical to the animal metagenomes. All microbiomes were characterized using reference-based taxonomic and functional profiling, as well as de novo assembly yielding metagenomic assembled genomes clustered into species-level genome bins. Companion animals shared 184 species-level genome bins not found in humans, whereas 198 were found in all three hosts. We applied novel methodology to distinguish strains of these shared organisms either transferred or unique to host species, with phylogenetic patterns suggesting host-specific adaptation of microbial lineages. This corresponded with functional divergence of these lineages by host (e.g., differences in metabolic and antibiotic resistance genes) likely important to companion animal health. This study provides the largest resource to date of companion animal gut metagenomes and greatly contributes to our understanding of the "One Health" concept of a shared microbial environment among humans and companion animals, affecting infectious diseases, immune response, and specific genetic elements.

## Quantitative Synthesis of Microbe-Driven Acclimation and Adaptation in Wild Vertebrates.
 12.10.2024, _G Martin Bideguren, O Razgour, A Alberdi_


Microorganisms associated with animals harbour a unique set of functional traits pivotal for the normal functioning of their hosts. This realisation has led researchers to hypothesise that animal-associated microbial communities may boost the capacity of their hosts to acclimatise and adapt to environmental changes, two eco-evolutionary processes with significant applied relevance. Aiming to assess the importance of microorganisms for wild vertebrate conservation, we conducted a quantitative systematic review to evaluate the scientific evidence for the contribution of gut microorganisms to the acclimation and adaptation capacity of wild vertebrate hosts. After screening 1974 publications, we scrutinised the 109 studies that met the inclusion criteria based on 10 metrics encompassing study design, methodology and reproducibility. We found that the studies published so far were not able to resolve the contribution of gut microorganisms due to insufficient study design and research methods for addressing the hypothesis. Our findings underscore the limited application to date of microbiome knowledge in vertebrate conservation and management, highlighting the need for a paradigm shift in research approaches. Considering these results, we advocate for a shift from observational studies to experimental manipulations, where fitness or related indicators are measured, coupled with an update in molecular techniques used to analyse microbial functions. In addition, closer collaboration with conservation managers and practitioners from the inception of the project is needed to encourage meaningful application of microbiome knowledge in adaptive wildlife conservation management.

Urbanizing global populations spend over 90% of their time indoors where microbiome abundance and diversity are low. Chronic exposure to microbiomes with low abundance and diversity have demonstrated negative long-term impacts on human health. Sequencing-based analyses of environmental nucleic acids are critical to understanding the impact of the indoor microbiome on human health, however low DNA yields indoors, alongside sample collection and processing inconsistencies, currently challenge study replicability. This study presents a comparative assessment of a novel, passive, easily replicable sampling strategy using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) sheets alongside a representative swab-based collection protocol. Deployable, customizable PDMS films designed for whole-sample insertion into standardized extraction kits demonstrated 43% higher DNA yields per sample, and 76% higher yields per cm2 of sampler over swab-based protocols. These results indicate that this accessible, scalable method enables sufficient DNA collection to comprehensively evaluate indoor microbiome exposures and potential human health impacts using smaller, more space efficient samplers, representing an attractive alternative to swab-based collection. In addition, this process reduces the manual steps required for microbiome sampling which could address inter-study variability, transform the current microbiome sampling paradigm, and ultimately benefit the replicability and accessibility of microbiome exposure studies.
