Wilson's disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder of chronic copper toxicosis with high mortality and disability. Recent evidence suggests a correlation between dysbiosis in gut microbiome and multiple diseases such as genetic and metabolic disease. However, the impact of intestinal microbiota polymorphism in WD have not been fully elaborated and need to be explore for seeking some microbiota benefit for WD patients. In this study, the 16S rRNA sequencing was performed on fecal samples from 14 patients with WD and was compared to the results from 16 healthy individuals. The diversity and composition of the gut microbiome in the WD group were significantly lower than those in healthy individuals. The WD group presented unique richness of Gemellaceae, Pseudomonadaceae and Spirochaetaceae at family level, which were hardly detected in healthy controls. The WD group had a markedly lower abundance of Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobia, and a higher abundance of Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria and Fusobacteria than that in healthy individuals. The Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio in the WD group was significantly lower than that of healthy control. In addition, the functional profile of the gut microbiome from WD patients showed a lower abundance of bacterial groups involved in the host immune and metabolism associated systems pathways such as transcription factors and ABC-type transporters, compared to healthy individuals. These results implied dysbiosis of gut microbiota may be influenced by the host metabolic disorders of WD, which may provide a new understanding of the pathogenesis and new possible therapeutic targets for WD.

## Emotional well-being and gut microbiome profiles by enterotype.
 02.12.2020, _SH Lee, SH Yoon, Y Jung, N Kim, U Min, J Chun, I Choi_


With increasing attention being paid to improving emotional well-being, recent evidence points to gut microbiota as a key player in regulating mental and physical health via bidirectional communication between the brain and gut. Here, we examine the association between emotional well-being and gut microbiome profiles (i.e., gut microbiome composition, diversity, and the moderating role of the enterotypes) among healthy Korean adults (n = 83, mean age = 48.9, SD = 13.2). The research was performed using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing to obtain gut microbiome profiles, as well as a self-report survey that included the Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS). The cluster-based analysis identified two enterotypes dominated by the genera Bacteroides (n = 49) and Prevotella (n = 34). Generalized linear regression analysis reveals significant associations between positive emotion and gut microbiome diversity (Shannon Index) among participants in the Prevotella dominant group, whereas no such relationship emerged among participants in the Bacteroides group. Moreover, a novel genus from the family Lachnospiraceae is associated with emotional well-being scores, both positive and negative. Together, the current findings highlight the enterotype-specific links between the gut microbiota community and emotion in healthy adults and suggest the possible roles of the gut microbiome in promoting mental health.

## The Composition and Concordance of Lactobacillus Populations of Infant Gut and the Corresponding Breast-Milk and Maternal Gut.
 11.01.2021, _X Zhang, S Mushajiang, B Luo, F Tian, Y Ni, W Yan_


The maternal gut is the principal source of commensal bacteria in the infant gut during the lactation stage, where breast milk acts as an intermediary for the transfer of potential probiotic bacteria consortia, including Lactobacillus. This study aimed to characterize the bacterial communities in human milk, maternal, and infant feces in a small yet very homogeneous cohort of 25 healthy mother-infant pairs in northwestern China (n = 25, infant age from 7 days to 2 years), with special emphasis on the cooccurrence and vertical transfer of Lactobacillus phylotypes at the species or strain level in mother-breast milk-infant triads. Accurate sequencing analysis revealed that among 73 Lactobacillus zero-radius operational classification units (ZOTUs) identified, 58 belonging to 18 recognized species or species groups were distributed in all three types of samples. Lactobacillus ruminis, L. mucosae and L. gasseri-johnsonii as true residents were the most represented in all three ecosystems, whereas the content of Lactobacillus phylotypes commonly developed as probiotics was not dominant. While the numbers of Lactobacillus species in breast milk and infant feces were greater than that in maternal feces, principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) based on beta diversity, coupled with the frequency of isolates determined by culture methods, showed that the Lactobacillus community in the infant gut was more similar to that in the maternal gut than to that in breast milk, suggesting that the gut is niche selective for Lactobacillus populations. In addition, identical strains of L. ruminis, L. paracasei, L. mucosae and L. salivarius were isolated from multiple mother-infant pairs, supporting the hypothesis that vertical transfer of bacteria via breastfeeding contributes to the initial establishment of the microbiota in the developing infant intestine.

## Lifestyle modifications result in alterations in the gut microbiota in obese children.
 11.01.2021, _KY Cho_


The association between the gut microbiota and pediatric obesity was analyzed in a cross-sectional study. A prospective study of obese children was conducted to assess the gut microbial alterations after a weight change. We collected fecal samples from obese children before and after a 2-month weight reduction program that consisted of individual counseling for nutritional education and physical activity, and we performed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing using an Illumina MiSeq platform.

## Nutritional combinatorial impact on the gut microbiota and plasma short-chain fatty acids levels in the prevention of mammary cancer in Her2/neu estrogen receptor-negative transgenic mice.

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women. Various nutritional compounds possess anti-carcinogenic properties which may be mediated through their effects on the gut microbiota and its production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) for the prevention of breast cancer. We evaluated the impact of broccoli sprouts (BSp), green tea polyphenols (GTPs) and their combination on the gut microbiota and SCFAs metabolism from the microbiota in Her2/neu transgenic mice that spontaneously develop estrogen receptor-negative [ER(-)] mammary tumors. The mice were grouped based on the dietary treatment: control, BSp, GTPs or their combination from beginning in early life (BE) or life-long from conception (LC). We found that the combination group showed the strongest inhibiting effect on tumor growth volume and a significant increase in tumor latency. BSp treatment was integrally more efficacious than the GTPs group when compared to the control group. There was similar clustering of microbiota of BSp-fed mice with combination-fed mice, and GTPs-fed mice with control-fed mice at pre-tumor in the BE group and at pre-tumor and post-tumor in the LC group. The mice on all dietary treatment groups incurred a significant increase of Adlercreutzia, Lactobacillus genus and Lachnospiraceae, S24-7 family in the both BE and LC groups. We found no change in SCFAs levels in the plasma of BSp-fed, GTPs-fed and combination-fed mice of the BE group. Marked changes were observed in the mice of the LC group consisting of significant increases in propionate and isobutyrate in GTPs-fed and combination-fed mice. These studies indicate that nutrients such as BSp and GTPs differentially affect the gut microbial composition in both the BE and LC groups and the key metabolites (SCFAs) levels in the LC group. The findings also suggest that temporal factors related to different time windows of consumption during the life-span can have a promising influence on the gut microbial composition, SCFAs profiles and ER(-) breast cancer prevention.

## Modeling dysbiosis of human NASH in mice: Loss of gut microbiome diversity and overgrowth of Erysipelotrichales.
 11.01.2021, _JK Carter, D Bhattacharya, JN Borgerding, MI Fiel, JJ Faith, SL Friedman_


Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a severe form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that is responsible for a growing fraction of cirrhosis and liver cancer cases worldwide. Changes in the gut microbiome have been implicated in NASH pathogenesis, but the lack of suitable murine models has been a barrier to progress. We have therefore characterized the microbiome in a well-validated murine NASH model to establish its value in modeling human disease.

## Geography as non-genetic modulation factor of chicken cecal microbiota.
 06.01.2021, _N Pin Viso, E Redondo, JM Díaz Carrasco, L Redondo, J Sabio Y Garcia, M Fernández Miyakawa, MD Farber_


The gastrointestinal tract of chickens harbors a highly diverse microbiota contributing not only to nutrition, but also to the physiological development of the gastrointestinal tract. Microbiota composition depends on many factors such as the portion of the intestine as well as the diet, age, genotype, or geographical origin of birds. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the influence of the geographical location over the cecal microbiota from broilers. We used metabarcoding sequencing datasets of the 16S rRNA gene publicly available to compare the composition of the Argentine microbiota against the microbiota of broilers from another seven countries (Germany, Australia, Croatia, Slovenia, United States of America, Hungary, and Malaysia). Geographical location played a dominant role in shaping chicken gut microbiota (Adonis R2 = 0.6325, P = 0.001; Mantel statistic r = 0.1524, P = 4e-04) over any other evaluated factor. The geographical origin particularly affected the relative abundance of the families Bacteroidaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Clostridiaceae. Because of the evident divergence of microbiota among countries we coined the term "local microbiota" as convergent feature that conflates non-genetic factors, in the perspective of human-environmental geography. Local microbiota should be taken into consideration as a native overall threshold value for further appraisals when testing the production performance and performing correlation analysis of gut microbiota modulation against different kind of diet and/or management approaches. In this regard, we described the Argentine poultry cecal microbiota by means of samples both from experimental trials and commercial farms. Likewise, we were able to identify a core microbiota composed of 65 operational taxonomic units assigned to seven phyla and 38 families, with the four most abundant taxa belonging to Bacteroides genus, Rikenellaceae family, Clostridiales order, and Ruminococcaceae family.

## Intestinal microbial communities of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) may be improved by feeding a Hermetia illucens meal/low-fishmeal diet.
 03.01.2021, _S Rimoldi, M Antonini, L Gasco, F Moroni, G Terova_


With demands and reliance on aquaculture still growing, there are various challenges to allow sustainable growth and the shift from fishmeal (FM) to other protein sources in aquafeed formulations is one of the most important. In this regard, interest in the use of insect meal (IM) in aquafeeds has grown rapidly. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to assess the effects of dietary IM from Hermetia illucens (Hi) larvae included in a low-FM diet on gut microbial communities of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), in terms of both composition and function of microbiome. A feeding trial was conducted using 192 trout of about 100-g mean initial weight. Fish were fed in quadruplicate (4 tanks/diet) for 131 days with two diets: the control (Ctrl) contained 20% of FM as well as other protein sources, whereas the Hi diet contained 15% of Hi larvae meal to replace 50% of the FM contained in the Ctrl diet. High-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene was used to identify the major feed and gut bacterial taxa, whereas Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt) analysis was performed on gut bacterial genomes to identify the major active biological pathways. The inclusion of IM led to an increase in Firmicutes, mainly represented by Bacilli class and to a drastic reduction of Proteobacteria. Beneficial genera, such as Lactobacillus and Bacillus, were enriched in the gut of fish fed with the Hi diet, whereas the number of bacteria assigned to the pathogenic Aeromonas genus was drastically reduced in the same fish group. The metagenome functional data provided evidence that dietary IM inclusion can shape the metabolic activity of trout gut microbiota. In particular, intestinal microbiome of fish fed with IM may have the capacity to improve dietary carbohydrate utilization. Therefore, H. illucens meal is a promising protein source for trout nutrition, able to modulate gut microbial community by increasing the abundance of some bacteria taxa that are likely to play a key role in fish health.
