The biodiversity hypothesis that contact with natural environments (e.g. native vegetation) and biodiversity, through the influence of environmental microbes, may be beneficial for human commensal microbiota has been insufficiently tested. We aimed to study the association between living near natural environments in the urban context, and gut microbiota diversity and composition in young infants. Based on data linkage between the unique Urban Primary Land and Vegetation Inventory (uPLVI) for the city of Edmonton and 355 infants in the CHILD Cohort Study, infant exposure to natural environments (any and specific types, yes/no) was determined within 500 m and 1000 m of their home residence. Gut microbiota composition and diversity at age 4 months was assessed in infant fecal samples. Adjusted for covariates, we observed a reduced odds of high microbial alpha-diversity in the gut of infants exposed to any natural environment within 500 m [Shannon index aOR (95%CI) = 0.63 (0.40, 0.98) and Simpson index = 0.63 (0.41, 0.98)]. In stratified analyses, these associations remained only among infants not breastfed or living with household pets. When doubly stratifying by these variables, the reduced likelihood of high alpha-diversity was present only among infants who were not breastfed and lived with household pets [9% of the study population, Shannon index = 0.07 (0.01, 0.49) and Simpson index = 0.11 (0.02, 0.66)]. Differences in beta-diversity was also seen (p = 0.04) with proximity to a nature space in not breastfed and pets-exposed infants. No associations were observed among infants who were fully formula-fed but without pets at home. When families and their pets had close access to a natural environment, Verrucomicrobiales colonization was reduced in the gut microbiota of formula-fed infants, the abundance of Clostridiales was depleted, whereas the abundance of Enterobacteriales was enriched. Our double-stratified results indicate that proximity to a natural environment plus pet ownership has the capacity to alter the gut microbiota of formula-fed infants. Further research is needed to replicate and better interpret these results, as well as to understand their health consequences.

## Breast cancer colonization by Fusobacterium nucleatum accelerates tumor growth and metastatic progression.
 01.07.2020, _L Parhi, T Alon-Maimon, A Sol, D Nejman, A Shhadeh, T Fainsod-Levi, O Yajuk, B Isaacson, J Abed, N Maalouf, A Nissan, J Sandbank, E Yehuda-Shnaidman, F Ponath, J Vogel, O Mandelboim, Z Granot, R Straussman, G Bachrach_


Fusobacterium nucleatum is an oral anaerobe recently found to be prevalent in human colorectal cancer (CRC) where it is associated with poor treatment outcome. In mice, hematogenous F. nucleatum can colonize CRC tissue using its lectin Fap2, which attaches to tumor-displayed Gal-GalNAc. Here, we show that Gal-GalNAc levels increase as human breast cancer progresses, and that occurrence of F. nucleatum gDNA in breast cancer samples correlates with high Gal-GalNAc levels. We demonstrate Fap2-dependent binding of the bacterium to breast cancer samples, which is inhibited by GalNAc. Intravascularly inoculated Fap2-expressing F. nucleatum ATCC 23726 specifically colonize mice mammary tumors, whereas Fap2-deficient bacteria are impaired in tumor colonization. Inoculation with F. nucleatum suppresses accumulation of tumor infiltrating T cells and promotes tumor growth and metastatic progression, the latter two of which can be counteracted by antibiotic treatment. Thus, targeting F. nucleatum or Fap2 might be beneficial during treatment of breast cancer.

## Microbiome diversity in Diaphorina citri populations from Kenya and Tanzania shows links to China.
 01.07.2020, _IJ Ajene, FM Khamis, B van Asch, G Pietersen, BA Rasowo, FL Ombura, AW Wairimu, KS Akutse, M Sétamou, S Mohamed, S Ekesi_


The Asian citrus psyllid (Diaphorina citri) is a key pest of Citrus spp. worldwide, as it acts as a vector for "Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (Las)", the bacterial pathogen associated with the destructive Huanglongbing (HLB) disease. Recent detection of D. citri in Africa and reports of Las-associated HLB in Ethiopia suggest that the citrus industry on the continent is under imminent threat. Endosymbionts and gut bacteria play key roles in the biology of arthropods, especially with regards to vector-pathogen interactions and resistance to antibiotics. Thus, we aim to profile the bacterial genera and to identify antibiotic resistance genes within the microbiome of different populations worldwide of D. citri. The metagenome of D. citri was sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore full-length 16S metagenomics protocol, and the "What's in my pot" (WIMP) analysis pipeline. Microbial diversity within and between D. citri populations was assessed, and antibiotic resistance genes were identified using the WIMP-ARMA workflow. The most abundant genera were key endosymbionts of D. citri ("Candidatus Carsonella", "Candidatus Profftella", and Wolbachia). The Shannon diversity index showed that D. citri from Tanzania had the highest diversity of bacterial genera (1.92), and D. citri from China had the lowest (1.34). The Bray-Curtis dissimilarity showed that China and Kenya represented the most diverged populations, while the populations from Kenya and Tanzania were the least diverged. The WIMP-ARMA analyses generated 48 CARD genes from 13 bacterial species in each of the populations. Spectinomycin resistance genes were the most frequently found, with an average of 65.98% in all the populations. These findings add to the knowledge on the diversity of the African D. citri populations and the probable introduction source of the psyllid in these African countries.

## Metagenomics analysis of fungal communities associated with postharvest diseases in pear fruits under the effect of management practices.
 26.06.2020, _A Zambounis, I Ganopoulos, A Tsaftaris, D Valasiadis, P Madesis_


An amplicon metagenomic approach based on the ITS1 region of fungal rDNA was employed to identify the composition of fungal communities associated with diseases of pear fruits during postharvest storage. The sampled fruits were harvested at an orchard using routine management practices involving treatments with various chemical fungicides and were transferred to a storage packinghouse. Effective tags of reading sequences clustered into 53 OTUs whereas Ascomycota was the dominant phylum (83.4%) followed by Basidiomycota (15.8%). Our results revealed that four genera, Penicillium, Rhodotorula, Alternaria and Cladosporium were the most abundant representing 59-95% of the relative abundance per sample. The interruption of chemical treatments during the last month before harvest altered the structure of the fungal community of fruits among untreated and treated samples, mainly in cases of relative abundance of Penicillium and Rhodotorula genera. We hypothesize that various antagonistic interactions might occur on fruit surfaces among the detected fungal genera whose relative abundances were affected by fungicide treatments. Interestingly, some common pre- and postharvest pear fungal pathogens were either less present (such as Moniliana), or undetected (such as Aspergillus, Venturia and Septoria) in untreated and treated samples.

## The Efficacy of Hydrogen Peroxide in Mitigating Cyanobacterial Blooms and Altering Microbial Communities across Four Lakes in NY, USA.
 02.07.2020, _MW Lusty, CJ Gobler_


Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has been proposed as an agent to mitigate toxic cyanobacterial blooms due to the heightened sensitivity of cyanobacteria to reactive oxygen species relative to eukaryotic organisms. Here, experiments were conducted using water from four diverse, eutrophic lake ecosystems to study the effects of H2O2 on cyanobacteria and non-target members of the microbial community. H2O2 was administered at 4 µg L-1 and a combination of fluorometry, microscopy, flow cytometry, and high throughput DNA sequencing were used to quantify the effects on eukaryotic and prokaryotic plankton communities. The addition of H2O2 resulted in a significant reduction in cyanobacteria levels in nearly all experiments (10 of 11), reducing their relative abundance from, on average, 85% to 29% of the total phytoplankton community with Planktothrix being highly sensitive, Microcystis being moderately sensitive, and Cylindrospermopsis being most resistant. Concurrently, eukaryotic algal levels increased in 75% of experiments. The bacterial phyla Actinobacteria, cyanobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Verrucomicrobia were most negatively impacted by H2O2, with Actinobacteria being the most sensitive. The ability of H2O2 to reduce, but not fully eliminate, cyanobacteria from the eutrophic water bodies studied here suggests it may not be an ideal mitigation approach in high biomass ecosystems.

## Microbial community composition across a coastal hydrological system affected by submarine groundwater discharge (SGD).
 29.06.2020, _D Adyasari, C Hassenrück, D Montiel, N Dimova_


Mobile Bay, the fourth largest estuary in the USA located in the northern Gulf of Mexico, is known for extreme hypoxia in the water column during dry season caused by NH4+-rich and anoxic submarine groundwater discharge (SGD). Nutrient dynamics in the coastal ecosystem point to potentially elevated microbial activities; however, little is known about microbial community composition and their functional roles in this area. In this study, we investigated microbial community composition, distribution, and metabolic prediction along the coastal hydrological compartment of Mobile Bay using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We collected microbial samples from surface (river and bay water) and subsurface water (groundwater and coastal pore water from two SGD sites with peat and sandy lithology, respectively). Salinity was identified as the primary factor affecting the distribution of microbial communities across surface water samples, while DON and PO43- were the major predictor of community shift within subsurface water samples. Higher microbial diversity was found in coastal pore water in comparison to surface water samples. Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidia, and Oxyphotobacteria dominated the bacterial community. Among the archaea, methanogens were prevalent in the peat-dominated SGD site, while the sandy SGD site was characterized by a higher proportion of ammonia-oxidizing archaea. Cyanobium PCC-6307 and unclassified Thermodesulfovibrionia were identified as dominant taxa strongly associated with trends in environmental parameters in surface and subsurface samples, respectively. Microbial communities found in the groundwater and peat layer consisted of taxa known for denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). This finding suggested that microbial communities might also play a significant role in mediating nitrogen transformation in the SGD flow path and in affecting the chemical composition of SGD discharging to the water column. Given the ecological importance of microorganisms, further studies at higher taxonomic and functional resolution are needed to accurately predict chemical biotransformation processes along the coastal hydrological continuum, which influence water quality and environmental condition in Mobile Bay.
