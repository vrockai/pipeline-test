## The Interplay of Sex Steroids, the Immune Response, and the Intestinal Microbiota.
 01.12.2020, _F Pace, PI Watnick_


The role of sex steroids in mammalian maturation is well established. Recently, it has been increasingly appreciated that sex steroids also play an important role in the propensity of adults to develop a myriad of diseases. The exposure and responsiveness of tissues to sex steroids varies among individuals and between the sexes, and this has been correlated with gender-specific differences in the composition of the intestinal microbiota and in susceptibility to metabolic, autoimmune, and neoplastic diseases. Here we focus on recent studies that demonstrate an interplay between sex steroids, the intestinal immune response, and the intestinal microbiota. While correlations between biological sex, the intestinal innate immune response, intestinal inflammation, and intestinal microbiota have been established, many gaps in our knowledge prevent the emergence of an overarching model for this complex interaction. Such a model could aid in the development of prebiotic, probiotic, or synthetic therapeutics that decrease the risk of autoimmune, metabolic, neoplastic, and infectious diseases of the intestine and mitigate the particular health risks faced by individuals receiving sex steroid treatment.

## Circulating 16S RNA in Biofluids: Extracellular Vesicles as Mirrors of Human Microbiome?
 01.12.2020, _V Ricci, D Carcione, S Messina, GI Colombo, Y D'Alessandra_


The human body is inhabited by around 1013 microbes composing a multicomplex system, termed microbiota, which is strongly involved in the regulation and maintenance of homeostasis. Perturbations in microbiota composition can lead to dysbiosis, which has been associated with several human pathologies. The gold-standard method to explore microbial composition is next-generation sequencing, which involves the analysis of 16S rRNA, an indicator of the presence of specific microorganisms and the principal tool used in bacterial taxonomic classification. Indeed, the development of 16S RNA sequencing allows us to explore microbial composition in several environments and human body districts and fluids, since it has been detected in "germ-free" environments such as blood, plasma, and urine of diseased and healthy subjects. Recently, prokaryotes showed to generate extracellular vesicles, which are known to be responsible for shuttling different intracellular components such as proteins and nucleic acids (including 16S molecules) by protecting their cargo from degradation. These vesicles can be found in several human biofluids and can be exploited as tools for bacterial detection and identification. In this review, we examine the complex link between circulating 16S RNA molecules and bacteria-derived vesicles.

## Microbiota and Obesity: Where Are We Now?
 01.12.2020, _A Ballini, S Scacco, M Boccellino, L Santacroce, R Arrigoni_


Genetic and environmental factors are underlying causes of obesity and other metabolic diseases, so it is therefore difficult to find suitable and effective medical treatments. However, without a doubt, the gut microbiota-and also the bacteria present in the oral cavity-act as key factors in the development of these pathologies, yet the mechanisms have not been fully described. Certainly, a more detailed knowledge of the structure of the microbiota-composition, intra- and inter-species relationships, metabolic functions-could be of great help in counteracting the onset of obesity. Identifying key bacterial species will allow us to create a database of "healthy" bacteria, making it possible to manipulate the bacterial community according to metabolic and clinical needs. Targeting gut microbiota in clinical care as treatment for obesity and health-related complications-even just for weight loss has become a real possibility. In this topical review we provide an overview of the role of the microbiota on host energy homeostasis and obesity-related metabolic diseases, therefore addressing the therapeutic potential of novel and existing strategies (impact of nutrition/dietary modulation, and fecal microbiota transplantation) in the treatment of metabolic disease.

## Vaginal Microbiome-Based Bacterial Signatures for Predicting the Severity of Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia.
 01.12.2020, _YH Lee, GU Kang, SY Jeon, SB Tagele, HQ Pham, MS Kim, S Ahmad, DR Jung, YJ Park, HS Han, JH Shin, GO Chong_


Although emerging evidence revealed that the gut microbiome served as a tool and as biomarkers for predicting and detecting specific cancer or illness, it is yet unknown if vaginal microbiome-derived bacterial markers can be used as a predictive model to predict the severity of CIN. In this study, we sequenced V3 region of 16S rRNA gene on vaginal swab samples from 66 participants (24 CIN 1-, 42 CIN 2+ patients) and investigated the taxonomic composition. The vaginal microbial diversity was not significantly different between the CIN 1- and CIN 2+ groups. However, we observed Lactobacillus amylovorus dominant type (16.7%), which does not belong to conventional community state type (CST). Moreover, a minimal set of 33 bacterial species was identified to maximally differentiate CIN 2+ from CIN 1- in a random forest model, which can distinguish CIN 2+ from CIN 1- (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.952). Among the 33 bacterial species, Lactobacillus iners was selected as the most impactful predictor in our model. This finding suggests that the random forest model is able to predict the severity of CIN and vaginal microbiome may play a role as biomarker.

## Personalized Nutrition Through The Gut Microbiota: Current Insights And Future Perspectives.
 01.12.2020, _D Vandeputte_


This narrative review discusses how to preserve or increase health through personalized nutritional products and services using microbiome data. In contrast to other reviews, which discuss this subject in the light of metabolic disorders and/or with a nutrition-affects-the-microbiota view, this review takes the perspective that the gut microbiota (GM) affects nutrition. Gut microbes affect host nutritional status through their role in energy harvest and nutrient availability. Consequently, GM modulation could contribute to fulfil nutritional requirements and in this way conquer malnutrition and disease. This review provides an overview of microbiota modulation methods that could be used to improve nutritional status as well as the personalization of these approaches. While some of these methods are immediately applicable, others require more development to assess their feasibility and safety.

## Harnessing the gut microbiota to promote metabolic health.
 01.12.2020, _N Zmora_


Precision medicine has become the mainstay of modern therapeutics, especially for neoplastic disease, but this paradigm does not commonly prevail in dietary planning. Compelling evidence suggests that individual features, including the structure and function of the gut microbiota, contribute to harvesting and metabolizing energy from food, and thereby modulate the host metabolic phenotype and glucose homeostasis. Here, the concept of precision to dietary planning is highlighted by demonstrating the role of the microbiota in glucose intolerance in response to noncaloric artificial sweeteners, and by linking the microbiota and other host features to postprandial increases in blood glucose. These findings highlight the heterogeneity that exists among humans, which translates into divergent metabolic responses to similar food and warrants the adoption of next-generation sequencing technologies and advanced bioinformatics to revolutionize nutrition studies, laying the groundwork for an individually focused tailor-made practice.

## Cage bedding modifies metabolic and gut microbiota profiles in mouse studies applying dietary restriction.
 02.12.2020, _A Gregor, L Fragner, S Trajanoski, W Li, X Sun, W Weckwerth, J König, K Duszka_


Experiments involving food restriction are common practice in metabolic research. Under fasted conditions, mice supplement their diet with cage bedding. We aimed at identifying metabolic and microbiota-related parameters affected by the bedding type. We exposed mice housed with wooden, cellulose, or corncob cage beddings to ad libitum feeding, caloric restriction (CR), or over-night (ON) fasting. Additionally, two subgroups of the ON fast group were kept without any bedding or on a metal grid preventing coprophagy. Mice under CR supplemented their diet substantially with bedding; however, the amount varied depending on the kind of bedding. Bedding-related changes in body weight loss, fat loss, cecum size, stomach weight, fecal output, blood ghrelin levels as well as a response to glucose oral tolerance test were recorded. As fiber is fermented by the gut bacteria, the type of bedding affects gut bacteria and fecal metabolites composition of CR mice. CR wood and cellulose groups showed distinct cecal metabolite and microbiome profiles when compared to the CR corncob group. While all ad libitum fed animal groups share similar profiles. We show that restriction-related additional intake of bedding-derived fiber modulates multiple physiological parameters. Therefore, the previous rodent studies on CR, report the combined effect of CR and increased fiber consumption.

## Influence of Environmental Stressors on the Microbiota of Zebra Mussels (Dreissena polymorpha).
 27.11.2020, _PP Mathai, JH Bertram, SK Padhi, V Singh, IE Tolo, A Primus, SK Mor, NBD Phelps, MJ Sadowsky_


Host-associated microbiota play a critical role in host fitness by providing nutrition, enhancing digestion capabilities, and by providing protection from pathogens. Here, we investigated the effects of two environmental stressors, temperature, and salinity, on the microbiota associated with zebra mussels (ZMs), a highly invasive bivalve in North America. To examine this in detail, lake-collected ZMs were acclimated to laboratory conditions, and subjected to temperature and salinity stress conditions. The impact of these stressors on the diversity, composition, and dynamics of ZM-associated microbiota were assessed by using amplicon- and shotgun-based sequencing, and qPCR-based approaches. Elevated temperature was found to be the primary driver of ZM mortality, although salinity alone also increased its likelihood. Stressor-induced ZM mortality, which ranged between 53 and 100%, was concomitant with significant increases in the relative abundance of several genera of putative opportunistic pathogens including Aeromonas. These genera were only present in low relative abundance in ZMs obtained from the control tank with 0% mortality. Shotgun sequencing and qPCR analyses indicated that the relative and absolute abundances of pathogenic Aeromonas species (particularly A. veronii) were significantly greater in temperature-induced dead ZMs. Taken together, our results show that environmental stress, especially elevated temperature (&gt; 25 °C), is associated with the rapid mortality of ZMs as well as the proliferation of putative opportunistic bacterial pathogens.

## Gut microbiota protects honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) against polystyrene microplastics exposure risks.
 01.12.2020, _K Wang, J Li, L Zhao, X Mu, C Wang, M Wang, X Xue, S Qi, L Wu_


Microplastic contamination is not only a pressing environmental concern in oceans, but also terrestrial ecosystems. However, little is known about its potential impacts on pollinators. Here, we reported the effects of 25 μm-diameter spherical polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) alone or in combination with the antibiotic tetracycline on honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) in the laboratory. We noticed that PS-MPs exposure for 14 d had sublethal effects, with low mortalities (up to 1.6 %) across three different treatments (0.5, 5, and 50 mg/L) and no changes to the body weight gains compared to the control bees. Nevertheless, PS-MPs exposure led to significant decreases in the α-diversity of bees' gut microbiota accompanied by changes to the core microbial population structure. Additionally, PS-MPs lead to alterations in the expression of antioxidative (Cat), detoxification (CypQ1 and GstS3), and immune system-related genes (Domeless, Hopscotch, and Symplekin) in guts. More interestingly, we observed that PS-MPs accumulated and degraded inside of the hindgut and interacted with gut bacteria. The depletion of the normal gut microbiota using tetracycline dramatically increased the lethality of microplastics. These results provide a resource for future research on microplastic-microbiome interactions in other insects and also shed light on understanding the potential effects of microplastics in terrestrial ecosystems.

## Cascading effects caused by fenoxycarb in freshwater systems dominated by Daphnia carinata and Dolerocypris sinensis.

To evaluate the aquatic hazards of the insect juvenile hormone analogue fenoxycarb, a single application (0, 48.8, 156.3, 500, 1600, and 5120 μg/L) of it was done in indoor freshwater systems dominated by Daphnia carinata (daphnid) and Dolerocypris sinensis (ostracoda). The responses of zooplankton (counted by abundance and the activity and immuno-reactive content of free N-Acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase (NAGase)), phytoplankton (counted by chlorophyll and phycocyanin), planktonic bacteria and fungi, and some water quality parameters were investigated in a period of 35 d. Results of the study showed that the ostracoda was more sensitive than daphnid, with time-weighted average (TWA)-based no observed effect concentrations (NOECs) to be 8.45 and 12.66 μg/L in systems without humic acid addition (HA-) and to be 6.37 and 9.54 μg/L in systems with humic acid addition (HA+). The duration of treatment-related effects in the ostracoda population was longer than the daphnid population (21 vs. 14 days). Besides, the data analysis indicated that the toxicity of fenoxycarb was significantly enhanced in the HA+ systems. Owing to the reduced grazing pressure, the concentrations of chlorophyll and phycocyanin increased in the two highest treatments. The increase in photosynthesis along with a reduced animal excretion led to an increase in pH and a decrease in nutrient contents. These changes seemed to have an effect on the microbial communities. For example, the abundances of some opportunistic pathogens of aquatic animals (e.g. Aeromonas and Cladosporium) and organic-pollutant-degrading microorganisms (e.g. Ancylobacter and Azospirillum) increased significantly in microbial communities, but the abundances of Pedobacter, Candidatus Planktoluna, and Rhodobacter (photosynthetic bacteria) markedly decreased. This study provides useful information to understand the ecotoxicological impacts of fenoxycarb at the population and community levels while integrating the effects of HA on toxicity.

## Evaluating and minimizing batch effects in metabolomics.
 25.11.2020, _W Han, L Li_


Determining metabolomic differences among samples of different phenotypes is a critical component of metabolomics research. With the rapid advances in analytical tools such as ultrahigh-resolution chromatography and mass spectrometry, an increasing number of metabolites can now be profiled with high quantification accuracy. The increased detectability and accuracy raise the level of stringiness required to reduce or control any experimental artifacts that can interfere with the measurement of phenotype-related metabolome changes. One of the artifacts is the batch effect that can be caused by multiple sources. In this review, we discuss the origins of batch effects, approaches to detect interbatch variations, and methods to correct unwanted data variability due to batch effects. We recognize that minimizing batch effects is currently an active research area, yet a very challenging task from both experimental and data processing perspectives. Thus, we try to be critical in describing the performance of a reported method with the hope of stimulating further studies for improving existing methods or developing new methods.
