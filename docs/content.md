The relevance of the human oral microbiome to our understanding of human health has grown in recent years as microbiome studies continue to develop. Given the links of the oral cavity with the digestive, respiratory and circulatory systems, the composition of the oral microbiome is relevant beyond just oral health, impacting systemic processes across the body. However, we still have a very limited understanding about intrinsic and extrinsic factors that shape the composition of the healthy oral microbiome. Here, we followed a citizen-science approach to assess the relative impact on the oral microbiome of selected biological, social, and lifestyle factors in 1648 Spanish individuals. We found that the oral microbiome changes across age, with middle ages showing a more homogeneous composition, and older ages showing more diverse microbiomes with increased representation of typically low abundance taxa. By measuring differences within and between groups of individuals sharing a given parameter, we were able to assess the relative impact of different factors in driving specific microbial compositions. Chronic health disorders present in the analyzed population were the most impactful factors, followed by smoking and the presence of yeasts in the oral cavity. Finally, we corroborate findings in the literature that relatives tend to have more similar oral microbiomes, and show for the first time a similar effect for classmates. Multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors jointly shape the oral microbiome. Comparative analysis of metabarcoding data from a large sample set allows us to disentangle the individual effects.

## Host-Population Microbial Diversity Scaling of Chinese Gut Microbiomes in Gout Patients.
 20.05.2022, _J Zhou, Y Yuan, P Xu, B Yi, H Chen, W Su_


Gout is a prevalent chronic inflammatory disease that affects the life of tens of millions of people worldwide, and it typically presents as gout arthritis, gout stone, or even kidney damage. Research has revealed its connection with the gut microbiome, although exact mechanism is still unclear. Studies have shown the decline of microbiome diversity in gout patients and change of microbiome compositions between the gout patients and healthy controls. Nevertheless, how diversity changes across host individuals at a cohort (population) level has not been investigated to the best of our knowledge. Here we apply the diversity-area relationship (DAR), which is an extension to the classic SAR (species-area relationship) and establishes the power-function model between microbiome diversity and the number of individuals within cohort, to comparatively investigate diversity scaling (changes) of gut microbiome in gout patients and healthy controls. The DAR modeling with a study involving 83 subjects (41 gout patients) revealed that the potential number of microbial species in gout patients is only 70% of that in the healthy control (2790 vs 3900) although the difference may not be statistically significant. The other DAR parameters including diversity scaling and similarity parameters did not show statistically significant differences. We postulate that the high resilience of gut microbiome may explain the lack of significant gout-disease effects on gut microbial diversity at the population level. The lack of statistically significant difference between the gout patients and healthy controls at host population (cohort) level is different from the previous findings at individual level in the existing literature.

As the leading cause of cancer death, lung cancer seriously endangers human health and quality of life. Although many studies have reported the intestinal microbial composition of lung cancer, little is known about the interplay between intestinal microbiome and metabolites and how they affect the development of lung cancer. Herein, we combined 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technology to analyze intestinal microbiota composition and serum metabolism profile in a cohort of 30 lung cancer patients with different stages and 15 healthy individuals. Compared with healthy people, we found that the structure of intestinal microbiota in lung cancer patients had changed significantly (Adonis, p = 0.021). In order to determine how intestinal flora affects the occurrence and development of lung cancer, the Spearman rank correlation test was used to find the connection between differential microorganisms and differential metabolites. It was found that as thez disease progressed, L-valine decreased. Correspondingly, the abundance of Lachnospiraceae_UCG-006, the genus with the strongest association with L-valine, also decreased in lung cancer groups. Correlation analysis showed that the gut microbiome and serum metabolic profile had a strong synergy, and Lachnospiraceae_UCG-006 was closely related to L-valine. In summary, this study described the characteristics of intestinal flora and serum metabolic profiles of lung cancer patients with different stages. It revealed that lung cancer may be the result of the mutual regulation of L-valine and Lachnospiraceae_UCG-006 through the aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis pathway, and proposed that L-valine may be a potential marker for the diagnosis of lung cancer.

Hospitalized patients receiving hematopoietic cell transplants provide a unique opportunity to study the human gut microbiome. We previously compiled a large-scale longitudinal dataset of fecal microbiota and associated metadata, but we had limited that analysis to taxonomic composition of bacteria from 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Here we augment those data with shotgun metagenomics. The compilation amounts to a nested subset of 395 samples compiled from different studies at Memorial Sloan Kettering. Shotgun metagenomics describes the microbiome at the functional level, particularly in antimicrobial resistances and virulence factors. We provide accession numbers that link each sample to the paired-end sequencing files deposited in a public repository, which can be directly accessed by the online services of PATRIC to be analyzed without the users having to download or transfer the files. Then, we show how shotgun sequencing enables the assembly of genomes from metagenomic data. The new data, combined with the metadata published previously, enables new functional studies of the microbiomes of patients with cancer receiving bone marrow transplantation.

## The gut microbiota: stable bioreactor of variable composition?
 18.05.2022, _G Mithieux_


The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in host health, providing energy and vitamins from food undigested by the gut enzymes of the host. Bacterial metabolites, such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), are essentially metabolized by the gut mucosa. The importance to metabolic health of gut microbiota composition versus function is discussed.

## Characterizing the mucin-degrading capacity of the human gut microbiota.
 19.05.2022, _JS Glover, TD Ticer, MA Engevik_


Mucin-degrading microbes are known to harbor glycosyl hydrolases (GHs) which cleave specific glycan linkages. Although several microbial species have been identified as mucin degraders, there are likely many other members of the healthy gut community with the capacity to degrade mucins. The aim of the present study was to systematically examine the CAZyme mucin-degrading profiles of the human gut microbiota. Within the Verrucomicrobia phylum, all Akkermansia glycaniphila and muciniphila genomes harbored multiple gene copies of mucin-degrading GHs. The only representative of the Lentisphaerae phylum, Victivallales, harbored a GH profile that closely mirrored Akkermansia. In the Actinobacteria phylum, we found several Actinomadura, Actinomyces, Bifidobacterium, Streptacidiphilus and Streptomyces species with mucin-degrading GHs. Within the Bacteroidetes phylum, Alistipes, Alloprevotella, Bacteroides, Fermenitomonas Parabacteroides, Prevotella and Phocaeicola species had mucin degrading GHs. Firmicutes contained Abiotrophia, Blautia, Enterococcus, Paenibacillus, Ruminococcus, Streptococcus, and Viridibacillus species with mucin-degrading GHs. Interestingly, far fewer mucin-degrading GHs were observed in the Proteobacteria phylum and were found in Klebsiella, Mixta, Serratia and Enterobacter species. We confirmed the mucin-degrading capability of 23 representative gut microbes using a chemically defined media lacking glucose supplemented with porcine intestinal mucus. These data greatly expand our knowledge of microbial-mediated mucin degradation within the human gut microbiota.

## Mapping microbiome-redox spectrum and evaluating Microbial-Redox Index in chronic gastritis.
 19.05.2022, _MK Panigrahi, V Kaliaperumal, A Akella, G Venugopal, B Ramadass_


Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and chronic gastritis are prevalent in developing countries. The role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal mucosal disorders is well recognized. In PUD, the gastric mucosa and its associated microbiome are subject to diet and stress-induced oxidative perturbations. Tissue redox potential (ORP) measurement can quantify oxidative stress, reflecting the balance between prooxidants and antioxidants. This study hypothesizes that the oxidative stress quantified by tissue ORP will be associated with characteristic changes in the mucosa-associated microbiome in PUD and gastritis. In addition, we propose using relative microbial abundance as a quantitative marker of mucosal health. Endoscopy was performed to obtain gastric mucosal biopsies from ten PUD and ten non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) patients. The tissue ORP was measured directly with a microelectrode using a biopsy specimen. A second specimen from an adjacent site was subjected to 16s rRNA gene sequencing. From the OTUs, the relative abundance of the microbial taxon in each of the samples was derived. We analyzed the genome of the predominant species for genes encoding the utilization of oxygen as an electron acceptor in respiration and for the presence of antioxidant defense mechanisms. The organisms were then grouped based on their established and inferred redox traits. Shannon diversity index and Species richness were calculated on rarefied data. The relative abundance of organisms that prefer high ORP over those that favor low ORP is conceived as the "Microbial Redox Index (MRI)," an indicator of mucosal health. In the gastric mucosa, aerobic species predominate and are more diverse than the anaerobes. The predominant aerobes are Helicobacter pylori and Sphingobacterium mizutaii. The abundance of these two species had an inverse correlation with the abundance of low ORP preferring anaerobes. Their relative abundance ratio (Microbial Redox Index) correlated with the tissue oxidation-reduction potential (ORP), a direct measure of oxidative stress. Correlation analysis also revealed that the abundance of all anaerobes inversely correlated with the dominant aerobic taxa. In addition, Shannon and Species richness diversity indices, the probable indicators of mucosal health, were negatively correlated with Microbial Redox Index. Using PUD as a prototype mucosal disease, this article describes a generalized approach to infer and quantify mucosal oxidative stress by analyzing the relative abundance of microorganisms that preferentially grow at the extremes of the tissue redox potential. This ratiometric Microbial Redox Index can also be assessed using simple qPCR without the need for sequencing. The approach described herein may be helpful as a widely applicable quantitative measure of mucosal health with prognostic and therapeutic implications.

There is growing interest on the potential clinical relevance of the endometrial microbiome. However, insufficient attention has been given to the methodology of sampling. To minimize contamination, we advocate the use of the double-lumen catheters commonly employed for the embryo transfer. Endometrial fluid samples obtained from 53 women scheduled for IVF were studied for microbiome characterization. Control samples from the vagina of these same women were concomitantly obtained. Samples were analysed by V3-V4-V6 regions of 16S rRNA gene sequencing with Next Generation Sequencing technique. Endometrial Lactobacillus-dominant cases were uncommon compared to previous evidence, being observed in only 4 (8%) women. Taxonomy markedly differed between the endometrial and vaginal microbiomes composition. The most common bacterial genera coincided in only 4 (8%) women. The comparison between women who did and did not subsequently become pregnant failed to identify any microorganism associated with the success of the procedure. However, the endometrial biodiversity resulted higher among pregnant women. Shannon's Equitability index in pregnant and non pregnant women was 0.76 [0.57-0.87] and 0.55 [0.51-0.64], respectively (p = 0.002). In conclusion, the use of embryo transfer catheters for testing the endometrial microbiome is promising. The scant concordance with vaginal samples supports the validity of this approach. Moreover, our study highlighted a possible beneficial role of a higher biodiversity on endometrial receptivity.

## Dysbiotic relationship between arthritis and the oral-gut microbiome. A critical review.
 18.05.2022, _RCG de Oliveira, E Gardev, LM Shaddox_


Arthritis and prosthetic joint infections (PJIs) overall are associated with reduced quality of life and limited work capacity. Multiple, overlapping factors contribute to these conditions. Some investigations have suggested a dysbiotic association between the oral-gut microbiome and pathogenesis of arthritis and PJIs. A better understanding of the role of the oral-gut microbiota in arthritis and PJI pathophysiology can shed light into how its disequilibrium can discharge a pro-inflammatory response, and impact the health of patients susceptible to arthritis or with established joint disease. A review of published in vivo and clinical data suggested that alterations in oral and gut microbiota can lead to a disturbance of immunoregulatory properties, and may be associated with joint infections and arthritis. This review brings new insights into the current status of the evidence on the potential molecules and inflammatory biomarkers disrupted by an oral-gut microbial dysbiosis. Normal commensals and pathogenic oral and gut microflora homeostasis are important not only to prevent infections per se but also its potential progression. Further experiments, especially controlled clinical trials, are needed to ascertain how microbiome manipulation and other microbiota-directed approaches can help control inflammation and effectively prevent and treat arthritic diseases. Additionally, studies on the effects of the long-term oral diseases, such as chronic periodontitis, on arthritis and PJIs need to be conducted.

## Intestinal microbiota composition of children with infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C).

Microbiota composition may play a role in the development, prognosis, or post-infection of COVID-19. There are studies evaluating the microbiota composition at the time of diagnosis and during the course of COVID-19, especially in adults, while studies in children are limited and no study available in children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). This study was planned to compare intestinal microbiota composition in children diagnosed with MIS-C and acute COVID-19 infection with healthy children. In this prospective multicenter study, 25 children diagnosed with MIS-C, 20 with COVID-19 infection, and 19 healthy children were included. Intestinal microbiota composition was evaluated by 16 s rRNA gene sequencing. We observed changes of diversity, richness, and composition of intestinal microbiota in MIS-C cases compared to COVID-19 cases and in the healthy controls. The Shannon index was higher in the MIS-C group than the healthy controls (p &lt; 0.01). At phylum level, in the MIS-C group, a significantly higher relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and lower abundance of Firmicutes was found compared to the control group. Intestinal microbiota composition changed in MIS-C cases compared to COVID-19 and healthy controls, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii decreased; Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides plebeius, Clostridium ramosum, Eubacterium dolichum, Eggerthella lenta, Bacillus thermoamylovorans, Prevotella tannerae, and Bacteroides coprophilus were dominant in children with MIS-C. At species level, we observed decreased Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, and increased Eubacterium dolichum, Eggerthella lenta, and Bacillus thermoamylovorans in children with MIS-C and increased Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Dorea formicigenerasus in the COVID-19 group. Our study is the first to evaluate the microbiota composition in MIS-C cases. There is a substantial change in the composition of the gut microbiota: (1) reduction of F. prausnitzii in children with MIS-C and COVID-19; (2) an increase of Eggerthella lenta which is related with autoimmunity; and (3) the predominance of E. dolichum is associated with metabolic dysfunctions and obesity in children with MIS-C.

## Super Dominant Pathobiontic Bacteria in the Nasopharyngeal Microbiota Cause Secondary Bacterial Infection in COVID-19 Patients.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory infectious disease responsible for many infections worldwide. Differences in respiratory microbiota may correlate with disease severity. Samples were collected from 20 severe and 51 mild COVID-19 patients. High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was used to analyze the bacterial community composition of the upper and lower respiratory tracts. The indices of diversity were analyzed. When one genus accounted for &gt;50% of reads from a sample, it was defined as a super dominant pathobiontic bacterial genus (SDPG). In the upper respiratory tract, uniformity indices were significantly higher in the mild group than in the severe group (P &lt; 0.001). In the lower respiratory tract, uniformity indices, richness indices, and the abundance-based coverage estimator were significantly higher in the mild group than in the severe group (P &lt; 0.001). In patients with severe COVID-19, SDPGs were detected in 40.7% of upper and 63.2% of lower respiratory tract samples. In patients with mild COVID-19, only 10.8% of upper and 8.5% of lower respiratory tract samples yielded SDPGs. SDPGs were present in both upper and lower tracts in seven patients (35.0%), among which six (30.0%) patients possessed the same SDPG in the upper and lower tracts. However, no patients with mild infections had an SDPG in both tracts. Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, and Acinetobacter were the main SDPGs. The number of SDPGs identified differed significantly between patients with mild and severe COVID-19 (P &lt; 0.001). SDPGs in nasopharyngeal microbiota cause secondary bacterial infection in COVID-19 patients and aggravate pneumonia. IMPORTANCE The nasopharyngeal microbiota is composed of a variety of not only the true commensal bacterial species but also the two-face pathobionts, which are one a harmless commensal bacterial species and the other a highly invasive and deadly pathogen. In a previous study, we found that the diversity of nasopharyngeal microbiota was lost in severe influenza patients. We named the genus that accounted for over 50% of microbiota abundance as super dominant pathobiontic genus, which could invade to cause severe pneumonia, leading to high fatality. Similar phenomena were found here for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The diversity of nasopharyngeal microbiota was lost in severe COVID-19 infection patients. SDPGs in nasopharyngeal microbiota were frequently detected in severe COVID-19 patients. Therefore, the SDPGs in nasopharynx microbiota might invade into low respiratory and be responsible for secondary bacterial pneumonia in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The extracellular vesicles (EVs) traffic constitutes an essential pathway of cellular communication. And the molecules in EVs produced by procaryotes help in maintaining homeostasis, addressing microbial imbalance and infections, and regulating the immune system. Despite the fact that Clostridium butyricum (C. butyricum) is commonly used for treating ulcerative colitis (UC), the potential role of C. butyricum-secreted EVs in commensals-host crosstalk remains unclear.

## Bee foraging preferences, microbiota and pathogens revealed by direct shotgun metagenomics of honey.
 20.05.2022, _A Galanis, P Vardakas, M Reczko, V Harokopos, P Hatzis, EMC Skoulakis, GA Pavlopoulos, S Patalano_


Honeybees (Apis mellifera) continue to succumb to human and environmental pressures despite their crucial role in providing essential ecosystem services. Owing to their foraging and honey production activities, honeybees form complex relationships with species across all domains, such as plants, viruses, bacteria and other hive pests, making honey a valuable biomonitoring tool for assessing their ecological niche. Thus, the application of honey shotgun metagenomics (SM) has paved the way for a detailed description of the species honeybees interact with. Nevertheless, SM bioinformatics tools and DNA extraction methods rely on resources not necessarily optimized for honey. In this study, we compared five widely used taxonomic classifiers using simulated species communities commonly found in honey. We found that Kraken 2 with a threshold of 0.5 performs best in assessing species distribution. We also optimized a simple NaOH-based honey DNA extraction methodology (Direct-SM), which profiled species seasonal variability similarly to an established column-based DNA extraction approach (SM). Both approaches produce results consistent with melissopalinology analysis describing the botanical landscape surrounding the apiary. Interestingly, we detected a strong stability of the bacteria constituting the core and noncore gut microbiome across seasons, pointing to the potential utility of honey for noninvasive assessment of bee microbiota. Finally, the Direct-SM approach to detect Varroa correlates well with the biomonitoring of mite infestation observed in hives. These observations suggest that Direct-SM methodology has the potential to comprehensively describe honeybee ecological niches and can be tested as a building block for large-scale studies to assess bee health in the field.

## Dietary wheat and reduced methane yield are linked to rumen microbiome changes in dairy cows.
 20.05.2022, _KW Savin, PJ Moate, SRO Williams, C Bath, J Hemsworth, J Wang, D Ram, J Zawadzki, S Rochfort, BG Cocks_


Fermentation of pasture grasses and grains in the rumen of dairy cows and other ruminants produces methane as a by-product, wasting energy and contributing to the atmospheric load of greenhouse gasses. Many feeding trials in farmed ruminants have tested the impact of dietary components on feed efficiency, productivity and methane yield (MeY). Such diets remodel the rumen microbiome, altering bacterial, archaeal, fungal and protozoan populations, with an altered fermentation outcome. In dairy cows, some dietary grains can reduce enteric methane production. This is especially true of wheat, in comparison to corn or barley. Using a feeding trial of cows fed rolled wheat, corn or barley grain, in combination with hay and canola, we identified wheat-associated changes in the ruminal microbiome. Ruminal methane production, pH and VFA concentration data together with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences were used to compare ruminal bacterial and archaeal populations across diets. Differential abundance analysis of clustered sequences (OTU) identified members of the bacterial families Lachnospiraceae, Acidaminococcaceae, Eubacteriaceae, Prevotellaceae, Selenomonadaceae, Anaerovoracaceae and Fibrobacteraceae having a strong preference for growth in wheat-fed cows. Within the methanogenic archaea, (at &gt;99% 16S rRNA sequence identity) the growth of Methanobrevibacter millerae was favoured by the non-wheat diets, while Methanobrevibacter olleyae was unaffected. From the wheat-preferring bacteria, correlation analysis found OTU strongly linked to reduced MeY, reduced pH and raised propionic acid levels. OTU from the genera Shuttleworthia and Prevotella_7 and especially Selenomonadaceae had high anti-methane correlations. An OTU likely representing (100% sequence identity) the fumarate-reducing, hydrogen-utilising, rumen bacterium Mitsuokella jalaludinii, had an especially high negative correlation coefficient (-0.83) versus MeY and moderate correlation (-0.6) with rumen pH, strongly suggesting much of the MeY suppression is due to reduced hydrogen availablity. Other OTU, representing as yet unknown species from the Selenomonadaceae family and the genera Prevotella_7, Fibrobacter and Syntrophococcus also had high to moderate negative MeY correlations, but low correlation with pH. These latter likely represent bacterial species able to reduce MeY without causing greater ruminal acidity, making them excellent candidates, provided they can be isolated, for development as anti-methane probiotics.

## Role of Insect Gut Microbiota in Pesticide Degradation: A Review.
 21.05.2022, _JA Siddiqui, MM Khan, BS Bamisile, M Hafeez, M Qasim, MT Rasheed, MA Rasheed, S Ahmad, MI Shahid, Y Xu_


Insect pests cause significant agricultural and economic losses to crops worldwide due to their destructive activities. Pesticides are designed to be poisonous and are intentionally released into the environment to combat the menace caused by these noxious pests. To survive, these insects can resist toxic substances introduced by humans in the form of pesticides. According to recent findings, microbes that live in insect as symbionts have recently been found to protect their hosts against toxins. Symbioses that have been formed are between the pests and various microbes, a defensive mechanism against pathogens and pesticides. Insects' guts provide unique conditions for microbial colonization, and resident bacteria can deliver numerous benefits to their hosts. Insects vary significantly in their reliance on gut microbes for basic functions. Insect digestive tracts are very different in shape and chemical properties, which have a big impact on the structure and composition of the microbial community. Insect gut microbiota has been found to contribute to feeding, parasite and pathogen protection, immune response modulation, and pesticide breakdown. The current review will examine the roles of gut microbiota in pesticide detoxification and the mechanisms behind the development of resistance in insects to various pesticides. To better understand the detoxifying microbiota in agriculturally significant pest insects, we provided comprehensive information regarding the role of gut microbiota in the detoxification of pesticides.

Soil microorganisms can colonize plant roots and assemble in communities engaged in symbiotic relationships with their host. While the compositional dynamics of root-associated microbiomes have been extensively studied, the host transcriptional response to these communities is poorly understood. Here, we developed an experimental system by which rice plants grown under axenic conditions can acquire a defined endosphere microbiome. Using this setup, we performed a cross-sectional characterization of plant transcriptomes in the presence or absence of a complex microbial community. To account for compositional variation, plants were inoculated with soil-derived microbiomes harvested from three distinct agricultural sites. Soil microbiomes triggered a major shift in the transcriptional profiles of rice plants that included the downregulation of one third to one fourth of the families of leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases and nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors expressed in roots. While the expression of several genes was consistent across all soil sources, a large fraction of this response was differentially impacted by soil type. These results demonstrate the role of root microbiomes in sculpting the transcriptomes of host plants and highlight the potential involvement of the two main receptor families of the plant immune system in the recruitment and maintenance of an endosphere microbiome.

## Water deficit affects inter-kingdom microbial connections in plant rhizosphere.
 18.05.2022, _KE Bazany, JT Wang, M Delgado-Baquerizo, BK Singh, P Trivedi_


The frequency and severity of drought are increasing due to anthropogenic climate change and are already limiting cropping system productivity in many regions around the world. Few microbial groups within plant microbiomes can potentially contribute towards the fitness and productivity of their hosts under abiotic stress events including water deficits. However, microbial communities are complex and integrative work considering the multiple co-existing groups of organisms is needed to better understand how the entire microbiome responds to environmental stresses. We hypothesize that water deficit stress will differentially shape bacterial, fungal, and protistan microbiome composition and influence inter-kingdom microbial interactions in the rhizospheres of corn and sugar beet. We used amplicon sequencing to profile bacterial, fungal, and protistan communities in corn and sugar beet rhizospheres grown under irrigated and water deficit conditions. The water deficit treatment had a stronger influence than host species on bacterial composition, whereas the opposite was true for protists. These results indicate that different microbial kingdoms have variable responses to environmental stress and host factors. Water deficit also influenced intra- and inter-kingdom microbial associations, wherein the protist taxa formed a separate cluster under water deficit conditions. Our findings help elucidate the influence of environmental and host drivers of bacterial, fungal, and protistan community assembly and co-occurrence in agricultural rhizosphere environments.

## Facilitating Reforestation Through the Plant Microbiome: Perspectives from the Phyllosphere.
 18.05.2022, _PE Busby, G Newcombe, AS Neat, C Averill_


Tree planting and natural regeneration contribute to the ongoing effort to restore Earth's forests. Our review addresses how the plant microbiome can enhance the survival of planted and naturally regenerating seedlings and serve in long-term forest carbon capture and the conservation of biodiversity. We focus on fungal leaf endophytes, ubiquitous defensive symbionts that protect against pathogens. We first show that fungal and oomycetous pathogen richness varies greatly for tree species native to the United States (n = 0-876 known pathogens per US tree species), with nearly half of tree species either without pathogens in these major groups or with unknown pathogens. Endophytes are insurance against the poorly known and changing threat of tree pathogens. Next, we reviewed studies of plant-phyllosphere feedback, but knowledge gaps prevented us from evaluating whether adding conspecific leaf litter to planted seedlings promotes defensive symbiosis, analogous to adding soil to promote positive feedback. Finally, we discuss research priorities for integrating the plant microbiome into efforts to expand Earth's forests. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Phytopathology, Volume 60 is August 2022. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.

## The standardisation of the approach to metagenomic human gut analysis: from sample collection to microbiome profiling.

In recent years, the number of metagenomic studies increased significantly. Wide range of factors, including the tremendous community complexity and variability, is contributing to the challenge in reliable microbiome community profiling. Many approaches have been proposed to overcome these problems making hardly possible to compare results of different studies. The significant differences between procedures used in metagenomic research are reflected in a variation of the obtained results. This calls for the need for standardisation of the procedure, to reduce the confounding factors originating from DNA isolation, sequencing and bioinformatics analyses in order to ensure that the differences in microbiome composition are of a true biological origin. Although the best practices for metagenomics studies have been the topic of several publications and the main aim of the International Human Microbiome Standard (IHMS) project, standardisation of the procedure for generating and analysing metagenomic data is still far from being achieved. To highlight the difficulties in the standardisation of metagenomics methods, we thoroughly examined each step of the analysis of the human gut microbiome. We tested the DNA isolation procedure, preparation of NGS libraries for next-generation sequencing, and bioinformatics analysis, aimed at identifying microbial taxa. We showed that the homogenisation time is the leading factor impacting sample diversity, with the recommendation for a shorter homogenisation time (10 min). Ten minutes of homogenisation allows for better reflection of the bacteria gram-positive/gram-negative ratio, and the obtained results are the least heterogenous in terms of beta-diversity of samples microbial composition. Besides increasing the homogenisation time, we observed further potential impact of the library preparation kit on the gut microbiome profiling. Moreover, our analysis revealed that the choice of the library preparation kit influences the reproducibility of the results, which is an important factor that has to be taken into account in every experiment. In this study, a tagmentation-based kit allowed for obtaining the most reproducible results. We also considered the choice of the computational tool for determining the composition of intestinal microbiota, with Kraken2/Bracken pipeline outperforming MetaPhlAn2 in our in silico experiments. The design of an experiment and a detailed establishment of an experimental protocol may have a serious impact on determining the taxonomic profile of the intestinal microbiome community. Results of our experiment can be helpful for a wide range of studies that aim to better understand the role of the gut microbiome, as well as for clinical purposes.

## Locality-Sensitive Hashing-Based k-Mer Clustering for Identification of Differential Microbial Markers Related to Host Phenotype.
 18.05.2022, _W Han, H Tang, Y Ye_


Microbial organisms play important roles in many aspects of human health and diseases. Encouraged by the numerous studies that show the association between microbiomes and human diseases, computational and machine learning methods have been recently developed to generate and utilize microbiome features for prediction of host phenotypes such as disease versus healthy cancer immunotherapy responder versus nonresponder. We have previously developed a subtractive assembly approach, which focuses on extraction and assembly of differential reads from metagenomic data sets that are likely sampled from differential genomes or genes between two groups of microbiome data sets (e.g., healthy vs. disease). In this article, we further improved our subtractive assembly approach by utilizing groups of k-mers with similar abundance profiles across multiple samples. We implemented a locality-sensitive hashing (LSH)-enabled approach (called kmerLSHSA) to group billions of k-mers into k-mer coabundance groups (kCAGs), which were subsequently used for the retrieval of differential kCAGs for subtractive assembly. Testing of the kmerLSHSA approach on simulated data sets and real microbiome data sets showed that, compared with the conventional approach that utilizes all genes, our approach can quickly identify differential genes that can be used for building promising predictive models for microbiome-based host phenotype prediction. We also discussed other potential applications of LSH-enabled clustering of k-mers according to their abundance profiles across multiple microbiome samples.
