## Prospective correlation between the patient microbiome with response to and development of immune-mediated adverse effects to immunotherapy in lung cancer.
 14.07.2021, _J Chau, M Yadav, B Liu, M Furqan, Q Dai, S Shahi, A Gupta, KN Mercer, E Eastman, TA Hejleh, C Chan, GJ Weiner, C Cherwin, STM Lee, C Zhong, A Mangalam, J Zhang_


Though the gut microbiome has been associated with efficacy of immunotherapy (ICI) in certain cancers, similar findings have not been identified for microbiomes from other body sites and their correlation to treatment response and immune related adverse events (irAEs) in lung cancer (LC) patients receiving ICIs.

## Differences in the individual curative effect of acupuncture for obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome based on metagenomic analysis: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.
 16.07.2021, _H Fan, X Hong, J Zeng, X Wang, J Chen_


Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common cause of infertility and shows a high incidence in women of reproductive age. Acupuncture is an appropriate adjunctive treatment for PCOS. However, the add-on effect of acupuncture as an adjunctive treatment for obese women with PCOS has not been studied, and previous studies indicate that there are individual differences in the curative effect of acupuncture, while deeper research on the mechanism of differences in the individual curative effect of acupuncture for obese women with PCOS is still lacking. This trial aims to assess the add-on treatment efficacy of acupuncture for obese women with PCOS and to explore the role of the gut microbiome on the differences in the individual curative effect of acupuncture based on metagenomic analysis.

## Gut microbial characteristics of adult patients with allergy rhinitis.

Although recent studies have indicated that intestinal microbiota dweller are involved in the pathogenesis of allergy rhinitis (AR), the influence of gut microbiota on AR adult has not been fully elucidated yet. Hence, we carried out this study to uncover the distinctive bacterial taxa that differentiate allergy rhinitis patients from healthy individuals. Feces samples from thirty three AR patients and thirty one healthy individuals were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

## A sociological autopsy lens on older adult suicide in rural Australia: Addressing health, psychosocial factors and care practices at the intersection of policies and institutions.
 16.07.2021, _SJ Fitzpatrick, D Read, BK Brew, D Perkins_


This paper examines the interrelationship between suicide, health, socioeconomic, and psychosocial factors in contributing to suicide in older adults in rural Australia. Drawing on a coronial dataset of suicide cases and a mixed methods sociological autopsy approach, our study integrated a quantitative analysis of 792 suicide cases with a qualitative analysis of medico-legal reports from 30 cases. The sociological autopsy provided novel insights into the entanglement of policy and service provision at the state-level with individual end-of-life decisions. Particular attention is drawn to age and gendered dimensions of suicide, especially in relation to health and social issues. The study showed a continuity between suicide and the patterning of an individual's life course, including experiences and consequences of inequality and marginality; a desire to meet culturally-normative ideals of autonomy; and a fragmented, under-funded, and intimidating social care system that offered limited options.

## Investigating components of pranayama for effects on heart rate variability.
 16.07.2021, _E Sharpe, A Lacombe, A Sadowski, J Phipps, R Heer, S Rajurkar, D Hanes, RD Jindal, R Bradley_


Traditional Indian breath control practices of Pranayama have been shown to increase indices of heart rate variability (HRV) that are generally held to reflect parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) tone. To our knowledge, individual components of pranayama have not been separately evaluated for impact on HRV. The objective of this study was to isolate five components of a pranayama practice and evaluate their impact on HRV.

## Altering the gut microbiome to potentially modulate behavioral manifestations in autism spectrum disorders: A systematic review.
 16.07.2021, _C Davies, D Mishra, RS Eshraghi, J Mittal, R Sinha, E Bulut, R Mittal, AA Eshraghi_


There is a potential association between gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and the severity of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Given this correlation, the possible impact of probiotics and prebiotics have been explored in research studies to modify the gut microbiome and ameliorate behavioral manifestations of ASD via modulating the gut-brain-microbiome axis. This systematic review focuses on the interplay between these factors in altering the behavioral manifestations of ASD. Probiotic supplementation tended to mitigate some of the behavioral manifestations of ASD, with less of a discernible trend on the microbiome level. Studies supplementing multiple probiotic species, such as microbiota transfer therapy, or including prebiotics performed better than single strain supplementation. Our analysis suggests that gut dysbiosis may increase intestinal permeability, leading to more severe GI symptoms and a systemic inflammatory response, which can alter permeability across the blood-brain barrier and synaptogenesis in the brain. Future studies are warranted to understand the precise contribution of altering gut microbiome on clinical manifestations of ASD that will open up avenues to develop preventive and treatment modalities.
