 20.09.2022, _M Zhang, L Shen, X Zhou, H Chen_


An in-depth understanding of the lung microbiota in tuberculosis (TB) infection could provide optimal strategies for the prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease. Only a few studies have investigated the impact of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection and anti-TB treatment on the lung microbiota. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and blood samples were collected from 23 active TB patients (TBZ), 17 latent tuberculosis infection patients (LTBI), 13 healthy controls (HC), and 14 active TB patients with 1-month anti-TB therapy (TBM) for 16S RNA sequencing and serological indexes, respectively. Low body mass index, albumin, and total triglyceride levels were detected in TBZ. Pulmonary Mtb infection led to a minor decrease in the alpha diversity of the lung microbiota in TBZ than HC, but a significant difference was noted in beta diversity. Subsequently, anti-TB therapy caused a rapid alteration in the lung community structure due to reduced alpha and beta diversity. Proteobacteria were abundant in TBZ samples, while Firmicutes was predominant in the LITB and HC samples. Lactobacillus and Subdoligranulum (genera) were the most unique in the LTBI and HC group, respectively. The TBM group showed the most predominant abundance of Bacteroides, Oscillospira, and Ruminococcus (genera). Functional pathways, such as indole alkaloid biosynthesis, Wnt signaling pathway, endocytosis, and metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450, significantly decreased in the TBM group compared with TBZ group. Pulmonary TB and anti-TB treatment caused a distinct dysbiosis of the lung microbiome. The current findings suggested potential links between the lung microbiota and TB onset, progression, and treatment.

Comorbid anxiety and depression are common and are associated with greater disease burden than either alone. Our recent efforts have identified an association between gut microbiota dysfunction and severity of anxiety and depression. In this follow-up, we applied Differential Co-Expression Analysis (DiffCoEx) to identify potential gut microbiota biomarker(s) candidates of treatment resistance among psychiatric inpatients.

## Modulatory role of gut microbiota in cholesterol and glucose metabolism: Potential implications for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease Atherosclerosis.
 20.09.2022, _J Roessler, DM Leistner, U Landmesser, A Haghikia_


Accumulating evidence suggests an important role of gut microbiota in physiological processes of host metabolism as well as cardiometabolic disease. Recent advances in metagenomic and metabolomic research have led to discoveries of novel pathways in which intestinal microbial metabolism of dietary nutrients is linked to metabolic profiles and cardiovascular disease risk. A number of metaorganismal circuits have been identified by microbiota transplantation studies and experimental models using germ-free rodents. Many of these pathways involve gut microbiota-related bioactive metabolites that impact host metabolism, in particular lipid and glucose homeostasis, partly via specific host receptors. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of how the gut microbiome can impact cardiometabolic phenotypes and provide an overview of recent advances of gut microbiome research. Finally, the potential of modulating intestinal microbiota composition and/or targeting microbiota-related pathways for novel preventive and therapeutic strategies in cardiometabolic and cardiovascular diseases will be discussed.

_Adult, Archaea, Bacteria, Diet, Ethnicity, Gastrointestinal Microbiome, Geography, Humans, Urbanization_
The human gut is home to a largely underexplored microbiome component, the archaeome. Little is known of the impact of geography, urbanization, ethnicity, and diet on the gut archaeome in association with host health. We aim to delineate the variation of the human gut archaeome in healthy individuals and its association with environmental factors and host homeostasis.

## Metabolic reconstitution of germ-free mice by a gnotobiotic microbiota varies over the circadian cycle.

The capacity of the intestinal microbiota to degrade otherwise indigestible diet components is known to greatly improve the recovery of energy from food. This has led to the hypothesis that increased digestive efficiency may underlie the contribution of the microbiota to obesity. OligoMM12-colonized gnotobiotic mice have a consistently higher fat mass than germ-free (GF) or fully colonized counterparts. We therefore investigated their food intake, digestion efficiency, energy expenditure, and respiratory quotient using a novel isolator-housed metabolic cage system, which allows long-term measurements without contamination risk. This demonstrated that microbiota-released calories are perfectly balanced by decreased food intake in fully colonized versus gnotobiotic OligoMM12 and GF mice fed a standard chow diet, i.e., microbiota-released calories can in fact be well integrated into appetite control. We also observed no significant difference in energy expenditure after normalization by lean mass between the different microbiota groups, suggesting that cumulative small differences in energy balance, or altered energy storage, must underlie fat accumulation in OligoMM12 mice. Consistent with altered energy storage, major differences were observed in the type of respiratory substrates used in metabolism over the circadian cycle: In GF mice, the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) was consistently lower than that of fully colonized mice at all times of day, indicative of more reliance on fat and less on glucose metabolism. Intriguingly, the RER of OligoMM12-colonized gnotobiotic mice phenocopied fully colonized mice during the dark (active/eating) phase but phenocopied GF mice during the light (fasting/resting) phase. Further, OligoMM12-colonized mice showed a GF-like drop in liver glycogen storage during the light phase and both liver and plasma metabolomes of OligoMM12 mice clustered closely with GF mice. This implies the existence of microbiota functions that are required to maintain normal host metabolism during the resting/fasting phase of circadian cycle and which are absent in the OligoMM12 consortium.

The gut microbiota is known to be associated with the regulation of many neurological diseases and behaviors, including chronic pain. However, it is unclear whether the gut microbiota is critical to the itch sensation. In this study, we investigated the effects of gut microbiota depletion on acute itch.

## Community and shotgun metagenomic analysis of Alligator mississippiensis oral cavity and GI tracts reveal complex ecosystems and potential reservoirs of antibiotic resistance.
 17.09.2022, _J Perez-Marron, C Sanders, E Gomez, S Escopete, T Owerkowicz, PM Orwin_


We report here the community structure and functional analysis of the microbiome of the Alligator mississippiensis GI tract from the oral cavity through the entirety of the digestive tract. Although many vertebrate microbiomes have been studied in recent years, the archosaur microbiome has only been given cursory attention. In the oral cavity we used amplicon-based community analysis to examine the structure of the oral microbiome during alligator development. We found a community that diversified over time and showed many of the hallmarks we would expect of a stable oral community. This is a bit surprising given the rapid turnover of alligator teeth but suggests that the stable gumline microbes are able to rapidly colonize the emerging teeth. As we move down the digestive tract, we were able to use both long and short read sequencing approaches to evaluate the community using a shotgun metagenomics approach. Long read sequencing was applied to samples from the stomach/duodenum, and the colorectal region, revealing a fairly uniform and low complexity community made up primarily of proteobacteria at the top of the gut and much more diversity in the colon. We used deep short read sequencing to further interrogate this colorectal community. The two sequencing approaches were concordant with respect to community structure but substantially more detail was available in the short read data, in spite of high levels of host DNA contamination. Using both approaches we were able to show that the colorectal community is a potential reservoir for antibiotic resistance, human pathogens such as Clostridiodes difficile and a possible source of novel antimicrobials or other useful secondary metabolites.

## Mangrove microbial community recovery and their role in early stages of forest recolonization within shrimp ponds.
 20.09.2022, _M Loiola, AET Silva, M Krull, FA Barbosa, EH Galvão, VF Patire, ICS Cruz, F Barros, V Hatje, PM Meirelles_


Shrimp farming is blooming worldwide, posing a severe threat to mangroves and its multiple goods and ecosystem services. Several studies reported the impacts of aquaculture on mangrove biotic communities, including microbiomes. However, little is known about how mangrove soil microbiomes would change in response to mangrove forest recolonization. Using genome-resolved metagenomics, we compared the soil microbiome of mangrove forests (both with and without the direct influence of shrimp farming effluents) with active shrimp farms and mangroves under a recolonization process. We found that the structure and composition of active shrimp farms microbial communities differ from the control mangrove forests, mangroves under the impact of the shrimp farming effluents, and mangroves under recolonization. Shrimp farming ponds microbiomes have lower microbial diversity and are dominated by halophilic microorganisms, presenting high abundance of multiple antibiotic resistance genes. On the other hand, control mangrove forests, impacted mangroves (exposed to the shrimp farming effluents), and recolonization ponds were more diverse, with a higher abundance of genes related to carbon mobilization. Our data also indicated that the microbiome is recovering in the mangrove recolonization ponds, performing vital metabolic functions and functionally resembling microbiomes found in those soils of neighboring control mangrove forests. Despite highlighting the damage caused by the habitat changes in mangrove soil microbiome community and functioning, our study sheds light on these systems incredible recovery capacity. Our study shows the importance of natural mangrove forest recovery, enhancing ecosystem services by the soil microbial communities even in a very early development stage of mangrove forest, thus encouraging mangrove conservation and restoration efforts worldwide.
