## Parasites, niche modification, and the host microbiome: A field survey of multiple parasites.
 19.03.2021, _KR O'Keeffe, FW Halliday, CD Jones, I Carbone, CE Mitchell_


Parasites can affect and be affected by the host's microbiome, with consequences for host susceptibility, parasite transmission, and host and parasite fitness. Yet, two aspects of the relationship between parasite infection and host microbiota remain little understood: the nature of the relationship under field conditions, and how the relationship varies among parasites. To overcome these limitations, we performed a field survey of the within-leaf fungal community in a tall fescue population. We investigated how diversity and composition of the fungal microbiome associate with natural infection by fungal parasites with different feeding strategies. Parasite feeding strategy affects both parasite requirements of the host environment and parasite impacts on the host environment. We hypothesized that parasites that more strongly modify niches available within a host will be associated with greater changes in microbiome diversity and composition. Parasites with a feeding strategy that creates necrotic tissue to extract resources (necrotrophs) may not only have different niche requirements, but also act as particularly strong niche modifiers. Barcoded amplicon sequencing of the fungal ITS region revealed that leaf segments symptomatic of necrotrophs had lower fungal diversity and distinct composition compared to segments that were asymptomatic or symptomatic of other parasites. There were no clear differences in fungal diversity or composition between leaf segments that were asymptomatic and segments symptomatic of other parasite feeding strategies. Our results motivate future experimental work to test how the relationship between the microbiome and parasite infection is impacted by parasite feeding strategy and highlight the potential importance of parasite traits.

## Large-scale functional network connectivity mediate the associations of gut microbiota with sleep quality and executive functions.
 19.03.2021, _H Cai, C Wang, Y Qian, S Zhang, C Zhang, W Zhao, T Zhang, B Zhang, J Chen, S Liu, J Zhu, Y Yu_


Network neuroscience has broadly conceptualized the functions of the brain as complex communication within and between large-scale neural networks. Nevertheless, whether and how the gut microbiota influence functional network connectivity that in turn impact human behaviors has yet to be determined. We collected fecal samples from 157 healthy young adults and used 16S sequencing to assess gut microbial diversity and enterotypes. Large-scale inter- and intranetwork functional connectivity was measured using a combination of resting-state functional MRI data and independent component analysis. Sleep quality and core executive functions were also evaluated. Then, we tested for potential associations between gut microbiota, functional network connectivity and behaviors. We found significant associations of gut microbial diversity with internetwork functional connectivity between the executive control, default mode and sensorimotor systems, and intranetwork connectivity of the executive control system. Moreover, some internetwork functional connectivity mediated the relations of microbial diversity with sleep quality, working memory, and attention. In addition, there was a significant effect of enterotypes on intranetwork connectivity of the executive control system, which could mediate the link between enterotypes and executive function. Our findings not only may expand existing biological knowledge of the gut microbiota-brain-behavior relationships from the perspective of large-scale functional network organization, but also may ultimately inform a translational conceptualization of how to improve sleep quality and executive functions through the regulation of gut microbiota.

## Factors Associated With the Microbiome in Moderate-Late Preterm Babies: A Cohort Study From the DIAMOND Randomized Controlled Trial.
 20.03.2021, _CYL Chong, T Vatanen, T Alexander, FH Bloomfield, JM O'Sullivan_


The gut microbiota of preterm infants is affected by perinatal factors and, in turn, may impact upon infant health. In this study, we collected fecal samples at Day-10 (D10) and 4-months corrected-age (4M) from 227 moderate-late preterm (MLPT) babies enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of nutritional management. A total of 320 samples underwent 16S amplicon sequencing, and shotgun metagenomic sequencing was performed on 94 samples from the 4M time point. The microbiome of babies whose families lived in lower socioeconomic status (SES) areas exhibited a significantly higher microbial alpha diversity at D10 (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.021), greater abundance of Bifidobacterium (linear model, q = 0.020) at D10 and Megasphaera (q = 0.031) at 4M. Hospital of birth explained 5.2% of the observed variance in 4M samples (PERMANOVA, p = 0.038), with Staphylococcus aureus more abundant in fecal samples from babies born in Middlemore hospital (linear model, q = 0.016). Maternal antibiotic (Wilcoxon test, p = 0.013) and probiotic (p = 0.04) usage within the four-week period before sample collection was associated with a reduction in the alpha diversity of D10 samples. Infant probiotic intake explained 2.1% (PERMANOVA, p = 0.021) of the variance in the D10 microbial profile with increased Lactobacillus (linear model, q = 1.1 × 10-10) levels. At 4M, the microbiome of infants who were breastmilk fed had reduced alpha diversity when compared to non-breastmilk fed infants (Wilcoxon test, p &lt; 0.05). Although causality cannot be inferred within our study, we conclude that in MLPT babies, maternal socioeconomic factors, as well as the perinatal medical environment and nutrition impact on the development of the newborn microbiome.

## Resident bacteria contribute to opportunistic infections of the respiratory tract.
 19.03.2021, _Y Wu, Y Wang, H Yang, Q Li, X Gong, G Zhang, K Zhu_


Opportunistic pathogens frequently cause volatile infections in hosts with compromised immune systems or a disrupted normal microbiota. The commensalism of diverse microorganisms contributes to colonization resistance, which prevents the expansion of opportunistic pathogens. Following microbiota disruption, pathogens promptly adapt to altered niches and obtain growth advantages. Nevertheless, whether and how resident bacteria modulate the growth dynamics of invasive pathogens and the eventual outcome of such infections are still unclear. Here, we utilized birds as a model animal and observed a resident bacterium exacerbating the invasion of Avibacterium paragallinarum (previously Haemophilus paragallinarum) in the respiratory tract. We first found that negligibly abundant Staphylococcus chromogenes, rather than Staphylococcus aureus, played a dominant role in Av. paragallinarum-associated infectious coryza in poultry based on epidemic investigations and in vitro analyses. Furthermore, we determined that S. chromogenes not only directly provides the necessary nutrition factor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) but also accelerates its biosynthesis and release from host cells to promote the survival and growth of Av. paragallinarum. Last, we successfully intervened in Av. paragallinarum-associated infections in animal models using antibiotics that specifically target S. chromogenes. Our findings show that opportunistic pathogens can hijack commensal bacteria to initiate infection and expansion and suggest a new paradigm to ameliorate opportunistic infections by modulating the dynamics of resident bacteria.

## The influence of nasal microbiome diversity and inflammatory patterns on the prognosis of nasal polyps.
 19.03.2021, _W Gan, H Zhang, F Yang, S Liu, F Liu, J Meng_


To understand the inflammatory microenvironment and microbiome factors for prognosis of chronic rhinosinusitis with polyps (CRSwNP), we explored the difference in characteristics of the microbiome of the nasal sinuses and inflammatory cytokines between recurrent and non-recurrent groups. We collected nasal secretions and polyp tissue from 77 CRSwNP patients. Then, we extracted microbial DNA from cotton swabs, performed high-throughput sequencing based on 16S rRNA to detect bacterial community composition, and analyzed cytokines such as IL-5, IL-8, IL-17a, IL-17e, IL-18, IL-27 and INF-gamma from polyp tissue using Luminex. The eosinophil and neutrophil cells in the peripheral blood and polyp tissue were counted. Postoperative follow-up of patients with CRSwNP for 1 year was conducted to record the recurrence of nasal polyps and analyze the correlation between the recurrence of nasal polyps and the characteristics of inflammatory cytokines, inflammatory cell count and nasal microbial diversity. After 1 year of follow-up, there were 12 recurrent patients, including 5 males and 7 females. Postoperative recurrence of nasal polyps was not significantly correlated with age, sex, asthma, allergic rhinitis or other allergic diseases in CRSwNP patients. In terms of the total nasal symptom score, the recurrent group was significantly higher than the non-recurrent group. In nasal polyp tissues, eosinophils (40.83/HP) and neutrophils (30.83/HP) in patients with CRSwNP in the recurrent group were significantly higher than those in the non-recurrent group (13.72/HP), and neutrophils (18.5/HP) were also significantly higher in the recurrent group than the non-recurrent group. The expression levels of IFN-, IL-17A, IL-17E and IL-18 were significantly higher in the recurrent group than in the non-recurrent group, and the positive rates were not different. In Southwest China, Enterobacteria and anaerobic bacteria may be correlated with the inflammatory pattern expression of nasal polyps. The neutrophil-mediated inflammatory response plays an important role in patients with CRSwNP in Southwest China and is correlated with nasal polyp recurrence. Recurrence of nasal polyps after endoscopic sinus surgery may be potentially associated with a reduced abundance of protective microorganisms and an increased number of pathogenic microorganisms.

## Persistence of the ground beetle (Coleoptera: Carabidae) microbiome to diet manipulation.
 19.03.2021, _A Silver, S Perez, M Gee, B Xu, S Garg, K Will, A Gill_


Host-associated microbiomes can play important roles in the ecology and evolution of their insect hosts, but bacterial diversity in many insect groups remains poorly understood. Here we examine the relationship between host environment, host traits, and microbial diversity in three species in the ground beetle family (Coleoptera: Carabidae), a group of roughly 40,000 species that synthesize a wide diversity of defensive compounds. This study used 16S amplicon sequencing to profile three species that are phylogenetically distantly related, trophically distinct, and whose defensive chemical secretions differ: Anisodactylus similis LeConte, 1851, Pterostichus serripes (LeConte, 1875), and Brachinus elongatulus Chaudoir, 1876. Wild-caught beetles were compared to individuals maintained in the lab for two weeks on carnivorous, herbivorous, or starvation diets (n = 3 beetles for each species-diet combination). Metagenomic samples from two highly active tissue types-guts, and pygidial gland secretory cells (which produce defensive compounds)-were processed and sequenced separately from those of the remaining body. Bacterial composition and diversity of these ground beetles were largely resilient to controlled changes to host diet. Different tissues within the same beetle harbor unique microbial communities, and secretory cells in particular were remarkably similar across species. We also found that these three carabid species have patterns of microbial diversity similar to those previously found in carabid beetles. These results provide a baseline for future studies of the role of microbes in the diversification of carabids.

## Pollinators mediate floral microbial diversity and network under agrochemical disturbance.
 19.03.2021, _N Wei, AL Russell, AR Jarrett, TL Ashman_


How pollinators mediate microbiome assembly in the anthosphere is a major unresolved question of theoretical and applied importance in the face of anthropogenic disturbance. We addressed this question by linking visitation of diverse pollinator functional groups (bees, wasps, flies, butterflies, beetles, true bugs and other taxa) to the key properties of the floral microbiome (microbial α- and β-diversity and microbial network) under agrochemical disturbance, using a field experiment of bactericide and fungicide treatments on cultivated strawberries that differ in flower abundance. Structural equation modeling was used to link agrochemical disturbance and flower abundance to pollinator visitation to floral microbiome properties. Our results revealed that (1) pollinator visitation influenced the α- and β-diversity and network centrality of the floral microbiome, with different pollinator functional groups affecting different microbiome properties; (2) flower abundance influenced the floral microbiome both directly by governing the source pool of microbes and indirectly by enhancing pollinator visitation; and (3) agrochemical disturbance affected the floral microbiome primarily directly by fungicide, and less so indirectly via pollinator visitation. These findings improve the mechanistic understanding of floral microbiome assembly, and may be generalizable to many other plants that are visited by diverse insect pollinators in natural and managed ecosystems.

Acute lung injury (ALI) not only affects pulmonary function but also leads to intestinal dysfunction, which in turn contributes to ALI. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation can be a potential strategy in the treatment of ALI. However, the mechanisms of synergistic regulatory effects by MSCs on the lung and intestine in ALI need more in-depth study.

## Aerobiological study of bacterial and fungal community composition in the atmosphere of Mexico City throughout an annual cycle.
 19.03.2021, _MDC Calderón-Ezquerro, N Serrano-Silva, C Brunner-Mendoza_


The atmosphere as a temporary habitat for airborne microbial communities is a valuable topic to explore, and it is through aerobiological studies that the diversity of biological particles and their release, emission, transport, deposition, and impact are assessed. Specific microorganisms are involved in meteorological processes, and phytosanitary and public health concerns. Airborne microbial composition is related to factors such as geographic region and weather conditions. In this study a metagenomic approach was used to determine the composition of bacterial and fungal communities in the air of two different land-use areas (urban area and semi-rural area), during dry and rainy seasons in Mexico City. Air sampling was carried out with a Hirst-type spore trap, collecting the samples simultaneously in both study areas. Forty-two bioaerosol samples were collected, and the DNA obtained was sequenced using Next-Generation Sequencing. The results indicated that the bacterial communities were represented mainly by the phyla Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria, and the fungal communities by the phyla Ascomycota followed by Basidiomycota. The evident changes in microbial composition were related more to seasonality than to locality, since both UA and SRA showed a high degree of urbanization, despite some differences in land use. Continuous monitoring of atmospheric bioaerosols is essential to determine the influence of meteorological factors on the composition of the aerial microbiota.

## Bio-therapeutics from Human Milk: Prospects and Perspectives.
 19.03.2021, _KS Singh, BP Singh, N Rokana, N Singh, J Kaur, A Singh, H Panwar_


Human milk is elixir for neonates and is a rich source of nutrients and beneficial microbiota required for infant growth and development. Its benefits prompted research into probing the milk components and their use as prophylactic or therapeutic agents. Culture-independent estimation of milk microbiome and high-resolution identification of milk components provide information, but a holistic purview of these research domains is lacking. Here, we review the current research on bio-therapeutic components of milk and simplified future directions for its efficient usage. Publicly available databases such as Pubmed, Google scholar were searched for keywords such as probiotics and prebiotics related to human milk, microbiome and milk oligosaccharides. This was further manually curated for inclusion and exclusion criteria relevant to human milk and clinical efficacy. The literature was classified into sub-groups and then discussed in detail to facilitate understanding. Although, milk research is still in infancy, but it is clear that human milk has many functions including protection of infants by passive immunization through secreted antibodies, transfer of immune regulators, cytokines and bioactive peptides. Unbiased estimates show that the human milk carries a complex community of microbiota which serves as the initial inoculum for establishment of infant gut. Our search effectively screened for evidence that shows that milk also harbors many types of prebiotics such as, human milk oligosaccharides which encourage growth of beneficial probiotics. The milk also trains the naive immune system of the infant by supplying immune cells and stimulatory factors, thereby strengthening mucosal and systemic immune system. Our systematic review would improve understanding of human milk and the inherent complexity and diversity of human milk. The interrelated functional role of human milk components especially the oligosaccharides and microbiome has been discussed which plays important role in human health.

## Synergistic Protective Effects of Different Dietary Supplements Against Type 2 Diabetes via Regulating Gut Microbiota.
 19.03.2021, _L Yu, X Zhou, H Duan, Y Chen, S Cui, R Guo, Y Xue, F Tian, J Zhao, H Zhang, Q Zhai, W Chen_


Diabetes mellitus is a global health problem, and its prevalence continues to increase. Dietary supplements, including probiotics, prebiotics, and plant extracts, have been shown to alleviate diabetes. In this study, the synergistic effects of two types of dietary supplements were investigated in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Sixty mice were divided into the following six groups: control, model (induced by a high-fat diet and intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin), drug (metformin), probiotic (Lactobacillus spp.), formula A (probiotics, plant extracts, and soybean peptide), and formula B (probiotics, prebiotics, and soybean peptide). All three dietary interventions (probiotic, formula A, and formula B groups) significantly reduced the blood glucose level and oral glucose tolerance level and effectively improved some biochemical parameters (e.g., chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and blood lipid level) and regulated gut microbiota. Notably, formula B exhibited a better ability on reducing the blood glucose level, regulating the gut microbiota, and increasing the short-chain fatty acid levels compared with the probiotics alone and formula A. Thus, formula B may exert synergistic protective effects against T2DM through a mechanism involving probiotics and prebiotics of gut microbiota regulation. This study provides a theoretical basis for the application of probiotic dietary supplements to the treatment of T2DM.

## Characterization of antibacterial activity of a N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase produced by Latilactobacillus sakei isolated from salami.
 19.03.2021, _A Lopez-Arvizu, D Rocha-Mendoza, E Ponce-Alquicira, I García-Cano_


Lactic acid bacteria are the predominant group within meat products, whose metabolites such as bacteriocins and peptidoglycan hydrolases inhibit pathogenic or spoilage bacteria. Fermented meat products, as a salami, is a good source to analyze the viable microbiota, due to these products present a low risk to consumer health. The aim of this work was to identify the lactic acid bacteria with broad antibacterial activity present in salami, purify the protein responsible for this activity, achieve antagonistic spectrum and perform the biochemical characterization. Five strains from salami were selected, isolated and identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by antagonism assay and zymography, using spoilage microorganisms commonly found in meat products. The strain that showed a broad antibacterial activity was Latilactobacillus sakei and the antibacterial activity was given by a protein with 75-kDa of molecular mass, identified by LC/MALDI-TOF/TOF. The sequence analysis showed 67% of identity with a N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine amidase protein with five non-identical LysM domains. The purified protein showed an optimal pH of 8.0 and heat resistance at 80 °C for 10 min. L. sakei strain displayed antibacterial activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive spoilage microorganisms. The results of this study provide the information to use Latilactobacillus sakei as a starter culture which will provide the necessary metabolites to combat undesirable microorganisms. Additionally, the conditions and properties for the best application and use of the antibacterial protein produced by this strain. This protein may have a potential use in the food industry as a new antibacterial agent.

## Administration of β-lactam antibiotics and delivery method correlate with intestinal abundances of Bifidobacteria and Bacteroides in early infancy, in Japan.
 19.03.2021, _N Imoto, C Kano, Y Aoyagi, H Morita, F Amanuma, H Maruyama, S Nojiri, N Hashiguchi, S Watanabe_


The intestinal microbiome changes dynamically in early infancy. Colonisation by Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides and development of intestinal immunity is interconnected. We performed a prospective observational cohort study to determine the influence of antibiotics taken by the mother immediately before delivery on the intestinal microbiome of 130 healthy Japanese infants. Faecal samples (383) were collected at 1, 3, and 6 months and analysed using next-generation sequencing. Cefazolin was administered before caesarean sections, whereas ampicillin was administered in cases with premature rupture of the membranes and in Group B Streptococcus-positive cases. Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides were dominant (60-70% mean combined occupancy) at all ages. A low abundance of Bifidobacterium was observed in infants exposed to antibiotics at delivery and at 1 and 3 months, with no difference between delivery methods. A lower abundance of Bacteroides was observed after caesarean section than vaginal delivery, irrespective of antibiotic exposure. Additionally, occupancy by Bifidobacterium at 1 and 3 months and by Bacteroides at 3 months differed between infants with and without siblings. All these differences disappeared at 6 months. Infants exposed to intrapartum antibiotics displayed altered Bifidobacterium abundance, whereas abundance of Bacteroides was largely associated with the delivery method. Existence of siblings also significantly influenced the microbiota composition of infants.

## Lactobacillus acidophilus LA5 improves saturated fat-induced obesity mouse model through the enhanced intestinal Akkermansia muciniphila.
 19.03.2021, _T Ondee, K Pongpirul, P Visitchanakun, W Saisorn, S Kanacharoen, L Wongsaroj, C Kullapanich, N Ngamwongsatit, S Settachaimongkon, N Somboonna, A Leelahavanichkul_


Obesity, a major healthcare problem worldwide, induces metabolic endotoxemia through the gut translocation of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a major cell wall component of Gram-negative bacteria, causing a chronic inflammatory state. A combination of several probiotics including Lactobacillus acidophilus 5 (LA5), a potent lactic acid-producing bacterium, has previously been shown to attenuate obesity. However, data on the correlation between a single administration of LA5 versus microbiota alteration might be helpful for the probiotic adjustment. LA5 was administered daily together with a high-fat diet (HFD) for 8 weeks in mice. Furthermore, the condition media of LA5 was also tested in a hepatocyte cell-line (HepG2 cells). Accordingly, LA5 attenuated obesity in mice as demonstrated by weight reduction, regional fat accumulation, lipidemia, liver injury (liver weight, lipid compositions, and liver enzyme), gut permeability defect, endotoxemia, and serum cytokines. Unsurprisingly, LA5 improved these parameters and acidified fecal pH leads to the attenuation of fecal dysbiosis. The fecal microbiome analysis in obese mice with or without LA5 indicated; (i) decreased Bacteroidetes (Gram-negative anaerobes that predominate in non-healthy conditions), (ii) reduced total fecal Gram-negative bacterial burdens (the sources of gut LPS), (iii) enhanced Firmicutes (Gram-positive bacteria with potential benefits) and (iv) increased Verrucomycobia, especially Akkermansia muciniphila, a bacterium with the anti-obesity property. With LA5 administration, A. muciniphila in the colon were more than 2,000 folds higher than the regular diet mice as determined by 16S rRNA. Besides, LA5 produced anti-inflammatory molecules with a similar molecular weight to LPS that reduced cytokine production in LPS-activated HepG2 cells. In conclusion, LA5 attenuated obesity through (i) gut dysbiosis attenuation, partly through the promotion of A. muciniphila (probiotics with the difficulty in preparation processes), (ii) reduced endotoxemia, and (iii) possibly decreased liver injury by producing the anti-inflammatory molecules.

## Linking Plant Secondary Metabolites and Plant Microbiomes: A Review.
 20.03.2021, _Z Pang, J Chen, T Wang, C Gao, Z Li, L Guo, J Xu, Y Cheng_


Plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) play many roles including defense against pathogens, pests, and herbivores; response to environmental stresses, and mediating organismal interactions. Similarly, plant microbiomes participate in many of the above-mentioned processes directly or indirectly by regulating plant metabolism. Studies have shown that plants can influence their microbiome by secreting various metabolites and, in turn, the microbiome may also impact the metabolome of the host plant. However, not much is known about the communications between the interacting partners to impact their phenotypic changes. In this article, we review the patterns and potential underlying mechanisms of interactions between PSMs and plant microbiomes. We describe the recent developments in analytical approaches and methods in this field. The applications of these new methods and approaches have increased our understanding of the relationships between PSMs and plant microbiomes. Though the current studies have primarily focused on model organisms, the methods and results obtained so far should help future studies of agriculturally important plants and facilitate the development of methods to manipulate PSMs-microbiome interactions with predictive outcomes for sustainable crop productions.

## Applications of Machine Learning in Human Microbiome Studies: A Review on Feature Selection, Biomarker Identification, Disease Prediction and Treatment.
 20.03.2021, _LJ Marcos-Zambrano, K Karaduzovic-Hadziabdic, T Loncar Turukalo, P Przymus, V Trajkovik, O Aasmets, M Berland, A Gruca, J Hasic, K Hron, T Klammsteiner, M Kolev, L Lahti, MB Lopes, V Moreno, I Naskinova, E Org, I Paciência, G Papoutsoglou, R Shigdel, B Stres, B Vilne, M Yousef, E Zdravevski, I Tsamardinos, E Carrillo de Santa Pau, MJ Claesson, I Moreno-Indias, J Truu_


The number of microbiome-related studies has notably increased the availability of data on human microbiome composition and function. These studies provide the essential material to deeply explore host-microbiome associations and their relation to the development and progression of various complex diseases. Improved data-analytical tools are needed to exploit all information from these biological datasets, taking into account the peculiarities of microbiome data, i.e., compositional, heterogeneous and sparse nature of these datasets. The possibility of predicting host-phenotypes based on taxonomy-informed feature selection to establish an association between microbiome and predict disease states is beneficial for personalized medicine. In this regard, machine learning (ML) provides new insights into the development of models that can be used to predict outputs, such as classification and prediction in microbiology, infer host phenotypes to predict diseases and use microbial communities to stratify patients by their characterization of state-specific microbial signatures. Here we review the state-of-the-art ML methods and respective software applied in human microbiome studies, performed as part of the COST Action ML4Microbiome activities. This scoping review focuses on the application of ML in microbiome studies related to association and clinical use for diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutics. Although the data presented here is more related to the bacterial community, many algorithms could be applied in general, regardless of the feature type. This literature and software review covering this broad topic is aligned with the scoping review methodology. The manual identification of data sources has been complemented with: (1) automated publication search through digital libraries of the three major publishers using natural language processing (NLP) Toolkit, and (2) an automated identification of relevant software repositories on GitHub and ranking of the related research papers relying on learning to rank approach.
