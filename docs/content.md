Preterm birth is the leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Microbiome dysbiosis in the mother and infant may contribute to their adverse outcomes. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was performed on all samples. Phyloseq, microbiomeSeq, and NetCoMi were utilized for bioinformatics analysis. Statistical tests included the Wilcoxon test, ANOVA, permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), and linear regression. Statistical significance was set at p value &lt;0.05. The establishment of an infant's microbiome most likely begins in utero and is influenced by the maternal microbiome. Infants' samples were enriched with Salmonella. There is a complex interplay among the microbial taxa noticeable at birth, exhibiting variability in interaction within the same host and across different hosts. Both maternal and infant microbiomes influence the anthropometric measures determined at birth, and a sex-based difference in correlation exists. This study highlights the potential role of maternal and infant microbiomes in improving pregnancy and neonatal outcomes.

Progression of chronic lung disease may lead to the requirement for lung transplant (LTx). Despite improvements in short-term survival after LTx, chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) remains a critical challenge for long-term survival. This study investigates the molecular and microbial relationships between underlying lung disease and the development of CLAD in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from subjects post-LTx, which is crucial for tailoring treatment strategies specific to allograft dysfunctions.

Obesity, and in particular abdominal obesity, is associated with an increased risk of developing a variety of chronic diseases. Obesity, aging, and menopause are each associated with differential shifts in the gut microbiome. Obesity causes chronic low-grade inflammation due to increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels which is termed "metabolic endotoxemia." We examined the association of visceral adiposity tissue (VAT) area, circulating endotoxemia markers, and the gut bacterial microbiome in a cohort of aged postmenopausal women.

## Failure of colonization following gut microbiota transfer exacerbates DSS-induced colitis.
 10.10.2024, _KL Gustafson, TR Rodriguez, ZL McAdams, LM Coghill, AC Ericsson, CL Franklin_


To study the impact of differing specific pathogen-free gut microbiomes (GMs) on a murine model of inflammatory bowel disease, selected GMs were transferred using embryo transfer (ET), cross-fostering (CF), and co-housing (CH). Prior work showed that the GM transfer method and the microbial composition of donor and recipient GMs can influence microbial colonization and disease phenotypes in dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis. When a low richness GM was transferred to a recipient with a high richness GM via CH, the donor GM failed to successfully colonize, and a more severe disease phenotype resulted when compared to ET or CF, where colonization was successful. By comparing CH and gastric gavage for fecal material transfer, we isolated the microbial component of this effect and determined that differences in disease severity and survival were associated with microbial factors rather than the transfer method itself. Mice receiving a low richness GM via CH and gastric gavage exhibited greater disease severity and higher expression of pro-inflammatory immune mediators compared to those receiving a high richness GM. This study provides valuable insights into the role of GM composition and colonization in disease modulation.

Gut microbiotas have important impacts on host health, reproductive success, and survival. While extensive research in mammals has identified the exogenous (e.g. environment) and endogenous (e.g. phylogeny, sex, and age) factors that shape the gut microbiota composition and functionality, yet avian systems remain comparatively less understood. Shorebirds, characterized by a well-resolved phylogeny and diverse life-history traits, present an ideal model for dissecting the factors modulating gut microbiota dynamics. Here, we provide an insight into the composition of gut microbiota in two high-altitude (ca. 3200 m above sea level) breeding populations of Kentish plover (Charadrius alexandrinus) and Tibetan sand plover (Charadrius altrifrons) in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, China. By analysing faecal bacterial communities using 16S rRNA sequencing technology, we find a convergence in gut microbial communities between the two species, dominated by Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. This suggests that the shared breeding environment potentially acts as a significant determinant shaping their gut microbiota. We also show sex- and age-specific patterns of gut microbiota: female adults maintain a higher diversity than males, and juveniles are enriched in Rhizobiaceae and Exiguobacterium due to their vegetative food resource. Our study not only provides a comprehensive descriptive information for future investigations on the diversity, functionality, and determinants of avian microbiomes, but also underscores the importance of microbial communities in broader ecological contexts.

Continuous cropping is a common cultivation practice in lavender cultivation, and the structure of the soil microbial community is one of the main reasons affecting the continuous cropping disorder in lavender; however, the relationship between the number of years of cultivation and inter-root microbial composition has not yet been investigated; using Illumina high-throughput sequencing we detected fungal community structure of rhizosphere soil under 1 (L1), 3 (L3), 5 (L5) and 0 (L0) years' of lavender cultivation in Yili, Xinjiang China. The results showed that with the extension of planting years, the physical-chemical characteristics of the soil shifted, and the diversity of the fungal communities shrank, the abundance and richness of species decreased and then increased, and the phylogenetic diversity increased, The structure of the soil fungal communities varied greatly. At phylum level, dominant fungal phyla were Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes, etc. At genus level, dominant genera were Gibberella, Mortierella, etc, whose absolute abundance all increased with increasing planting years (P &lt; 0.05); redundancy analysis showed that thesoil physicochemical characteristics significantly correlated with dominant bacterial genera. The FUN Guild prediction showed that six groups of plant pathogens and plant saprotrophs changed significantly (P &lt; 0.05), the amount of harmful bacteria in the soil increased while the amount of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungui (AMF) decreased, leading to a continuous cropping obstacle of lavender. The findings of this study provida theoretical foundation for the management of continuous cropping and the prevention fungus-related diseases in lavender.

The extreme environment of the International Space Station (ISS) puts selective pressure on microorganisms unintentionally introduced during its 20+ years of service as a low-orbit science platform and human habitat. Such pressure leads to the development of new features not found in the Earth-bound relatives, which enable them to adapt to unfavorable conditions.

## High accuracy meets high throughput for near full-length 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing on the Nanopore platform.
 10.10.2024, _X Lin, K Waring, H Ghezzi, C Tropini, J Tyson, RM Ziels_


Small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing is a foundational method in microbial ecology. Currently, short-read platforms are commonly employed for high-throughput applications of SSU rRNA amplicon sequencing, but at the cost of poor taxonomic classification due to limited fragment lengths. The Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platform can sequence full-length SSU rRNA genes, but its lower raw-read accuracy has so-far limited accurate taxonomic classification and de novo feature generation. Here, we present a sequencing workflow, termed ssUMI, that combines unique molecular identifier (UMI)-based error correction with newer (R10.4+) ONT chemistry and sample barcoding to enable high throughput near full-length SSU rRNA (e.g. 16S rRNA) amplicon sequencing. The ssUMI workflow generated near full-length 16S rRNA consensus sequences with 99.99% mean accuracy using a minimum subread coverage of 3×, surpassing the accuracy of Illumina short reads. The consensus sequences generated with ssUMI were used to produce error-free de novo sequence features with no false positives with two microbial community standards. In contrast, Nanopore raw reads produced erroneous de novo sequence features, indicating that UMI-based error correction is currently necessary for high-accuracy microbial profiling with R10.4+ ONT sequencing chemistries. We showcase the cost-competitive scalability of the ssUMI workflow by sequencing 87 time-series wastewater samples and 27 human gut samples, obtaining quantitative ecological insights that were missed by short-read amplicon sequencing. ssUMI, therefore, enables accurate and low-cost full-length 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing on Nanopore, improving accessibility to high-resolution microbiome science.
