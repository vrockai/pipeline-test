## Discovery and mining of enzymes from the human gut microbiome.
 26.07.2021, _B Jia, X Han, KH Kim, CO Jeon_


Advances in technological and bioinformatics approaches have led to the generation of a plethora of human gut metagenomic datasets. Metabolomics has also provided substantial data regarding the small metabolites produced and modified by the microbiota. Comparatively, the microbial enzymes mediating the transformation of metabolites have not been intensively investigated. Here, we discuss the recent efforts and technologies used for discovering and mining enzymes from the human gut microbiota. The wealth of knowledge on metabolites, reactions, genome sequences, and structures of proteins, may drive the development of strategies for enzyme mining. Ongoing efforts to annotate gut microbiota enzymes will explain catalytic mechanisms that may guide the clinical applications of the gut microbiome for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

## Antimicrobial peptides and proteins: Interaction with the skin microbiota.
 26.07.2021, _F Rademacher, R Gläser, J Harder_


The cutaneous microbiota comprises all living skin microorganisms. There is increasing evidence that the microbiota plays a crucial role in skin homeostasis. Accordingly, a dysbiosis of the microbiota may trigger cutaneous inflammation. The need for a balanced microbiota requires specific regulatory mechanisms that control and shape the microbiota. In this review we highlight the present knowledge suggesting that antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) may exert a substantial influence on the microbiota by controlling their growth. This is supported by own data showing the differential influence of principal skin-derived AMPs on commensal staphylococci. Vice versa we also illuminate how the cutaneous microbiota interacts with skin-derived AMPs by modulating AMP expression and how microbiota members protect themselves from the antimicrobial activity of AMPs. Taken together, the current picture suggests that a fine-tuned and well-balanced AMP-microbiota interplay on the skin surface may be crucial for skin health.

## Malnutrition and the microbiome as modifiers of early neurodevelopment.
 25.07.2021, _EJL Coley, EY Hsiao_


Malnutrition refers to a dearth, excess, or altered differential ratios of calories, macronutrients, or micronutrients. Malnutrition, particularly during early life, is a pressing global health and socioeconomic burden that is increasingly associated with neurodevelopmental impairments. Understanding how perinatal malnutrition influences brain development is crucial to uncovering fundamental mechanisms for establishing behavioral neurocircuits, with the potential to inform public policy and clinical interventions for neurodevelopmental conditions. Recent studies reveal that the gut microbiome can mediate dietary effects on host physiology and that the microbiome modulates the development and function of the nervous system. This review discusses evidence that perinatal malnutrition alters brain development and examines the maternal and neonatal microbiome as a potential contributing factor.

## Diet Interventions for Irritable Bowel Syndrome: Separating the Wheat from the Chafe.
 26.07.2021, _E Haller, K Scarlata_


Patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) frequently perceive eating food as a trigger to their gastrointestinal (GI) distress. Several factors involved in driving GI symptoms include malabsorption and fermentation of food substrates, gut microbiota alterations, nocebo and placebo response, and mast cell activation. Nutritional interventions require individualization based on the heterogeneity of symptoms as well as the risk for maladaptive eating patterns that present in those with IBS. Despite the variety of interventions marketed to individuals with IBS, the low Fermentable, Oligo-, Di-Mono-saccharide, and Polyol diet has the most evidence for efficacy in symptom management.

## Emerging Role of the Gut Microbiome in Irritable Bowel Syndrome.
 26.07.2021, _P Singh, A Lembo_


Advances in bioinformatics have facilitated investigation of the role of gut microbiota in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This article describes the evidence from epidemiologic and clinical observational studies highlighting the link between IBS and gut microbiome by investigating postinfection IBS, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, and microbial dysbiosis. It highlights the effects of gut microbiota on mechanisms implicated in the pathophysiology of IBS, including gut-brain axis, visceral hypersensitivity, motility, epithelial barrier, and immune activation. In addition, it summarizes the current evidence on microbiome-guided therapies in IBS, including probiotics, antibiotics, diet, and fecal microbiota transplant.

## The Types and Proportions of Commensal Microbiota Have a Predictive Value in Coronary Heart Disease.
 26.07.2021, _L Chen, T Ishigami, H Doi, K Arakawa, K Tamura_


Previous clinical studies have suggested that commensal microbiota play an important role in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; however, a synthetic analysis of coronary heart disease (CHD) has yet to be performed. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the specific types of commensal microbiota associated with CHD by performing a systematic review of prospective observational studies that have assessed associations between commensal microbiota and CHD. Of the 544 published articles identified in the initial search, 16 publications with data from 16 cohort studies (2210 patients) were included in the analysis. The combined data showed that Bacteroides and Prevotella were commonly identified among nine articles (n = 13) in the fecal samples of patients with CHD, while seven articles commonly identified Firmicutes. Moreover, several types of commensal microbiota were common to atherosclerotic plaque and blood or gut samples in 16 cohort studies. For example, Veillonella, Proteobacteria, and Streptococcus were identified among the plaque and fecal samples, whereas Clostridium was commonly identified among blood and fecal samples of patients with CHD. Collectively, our findings suggest that several types of commensal microbiota are associated with CHD, and their presence may correlate with disease markers of CHD.

## Association of Microbiome with Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Systematic Review of the Metagenomic Studies.
 26.07.2021, _L Su Mun, S Wye Lum, G Kong Yuiin Sze, C Hock Yoong, K Ching Yung, L Kah Lok, D Gopinath_


The past decade has witnessed a surge in epidemiological studies that have explored the relationship between the oral microbiome and oral cancer. Owing to the diversity of the published data, a comprehensive systematic overview of the currently available evidence is critical. This review summarises the current evidence on the metagenomic studies on the oral microbiome in oral cancer. A systematic search was conducted in Medline and Embase databases to identify original studies examining the differences in the oral microbiome of oral cancer cases and controls. A total of twenty-six studies were identified that reported differences in microbial abundance between oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and controls. Although almost all the studies identified microbial dysbiosis to be associated with oral cancer, the detailed qualitative analysis did not reveal the presence/abundance of any individual bacteria or a consortium to be consistently enriched in OSCC samples across the studies. Interestingly, few studies reported a surge of periodontopathogenic taxa, especially Fusobacteria, whereas others demonstrated a depletion of commensal taxa Streptococci. Considerable heterogeneity could be identified in the parameters used for designing the studies as well as reporting the microbial data. If microbiome data needs to be translated in the future, to complement the clinical parameters for diagnosis and prognosis of oral cancer, further studies with the integration of clinical variables, adequate statistical power, reproducible methods, and models are required.

Imbalanced colonic microbial metabolism plays a pivotal role in generating protein-bound uraemic toxins (PBUTs), which accumulate with deteriorating kidney function and contribute to the uraemic burden of children with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Dietary choices impact the gut microbiome and metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between dietary fibre and gut-derived PBUTs in paediatric CKD. Sixty-one (44 male) CKD children (9 ± 5 years) were prospectively followed for two years. Dietary fibre intake was evaluated by either 24-h recalls (73%) or 3-day food records (27%) at the same time of blood sampling for assessment of total and free serum levels of different PBUTs using liquid chromatography. We used linear mixed models to assess associations between fibre intake and PBUT levels. We found an inverse association between increase in fibre consumption (g/day) and serum concentrations of free indoxyl sulfate (-3.1% (-5.9%; -0.3%) (p = 0.035)), free p-cresyl sulfate (-2.5% (-4.7%; -0.3%) (p = 0.034)), total indole acetic acid (IAA) (-1.6% (-3.0%; -0.3%) (p = 0.020)), free IAA (-6.6% (-9.3%; -3.7%) (p &lt; 0.001)), total serum p-cresyl glucuronide (pCG) (-3.0% (-5.6%; -0.5%) (p = 0.021)) and free pCG levels (-3.3% (-5.8%; -0.8%) (p = 0.010)). The observed associations between dietary fibre intake and the investigated PBUTs highlight potential benefits of fibre intake for the paediatric CKD population. The present observational findings should inform and guide adaptations of dietary prescriptions in children with CKD.

Exposure to a diverse microbial environment during pregnancy and early postnatal period is important in determining predisposition towards allergy. However, the effect of environmental microbiota exposure on allergy during preconception, pregnancy and postnatal life on development of allergy in the child has not been investigated so far. In the S-PRESTO (Singapore PREconception Study of long Term maternal and child Outcomes) cohort, we collected house dust during all three critical window periods and analysed microbial composition using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. At 6 and 18 months, the child was assessed for eczema by clinicians. In the eczema group, household environmental microbiota was characterized by presence of human-associated bacteria Actinomyces, Anaerococcus, Finegoldia, Micrococcus, Prevotella and Propionibacterium at all time points, suggesting their possible contributions to regulating host immunity and increasing the susceptibility to eczema. In the home environment of the control group, putative protective effect of an environmental microbe Planomicrobium (Planococcaceae family) was observed to be significantly higher than that in the eczema group. Network correlation analysis demonstrated inverse relationships between beneficial Planomicrobium and human associated bacteria (Actinomyces, Anaerococcus, Finegoldia, Micrococcus, Prevotella and Propionibacterium). Exposure to natural environmental microbiota may be beneficial to modulate shed human associated microbiota in an indoor environment. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

## Longitudinal linked-read sequencing reveals ecological and evolutionary responses of a human gut microbiome during antibiotic treatment.
 24.07.2021, _M Roodgar, BH Good, NR Garud, S Martis, M Avula, W Zhou, SM Lancaster, H Lee, A Babveyh, S Nesamoney, KS Pollard, MP Snyder_


Gut microbial communities can respond to antibiotic perturbations by rapidly altering their taxonomic and functional composition. However, little is known about the strain-level processes that drive this collective response. Here, we characterize the gut microbiome of a single individual at high temporal and genetic resolution through a period of health, disease, antibiotic treatment, and recovery. We used deep, linked-read metagenomic sequencing to track the longitudinal trajectories of thousands of single nucleotide variants within 36 species, which allowed us to contrast these genetic dynamics with the ecological fluctuations at the species level. We found that antibiotics can drive rapid shifts in the genetic composition of individual species, often involving incomplete genome-wide sweeps of pre-existing variants. These genetic changes were frequently observed in species without obvious changes in species abundance, emphasizing the importance of monitoring diversity below the species level. We also found that many sweeping variants quickly reverted to their baseline levels once antibiotic treatment had concluded, demonstrating that the ecological resilience of the microbiota can sometimes extend all the way down to the genetic level. Our results provide new insights into the population genetic forces that shape individual microbiomes on therapeutically relevant timescales, with potential implications for personalized health and disease.

## Combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation is associated with prolonged recurrence-free survival following surgery for colorectal cancer.
 26.07.2021, _LM Zhang, D Schuitevoerder, MG White, S Feldt, P Krishnan, N Hyman, BD Shogan_


Recent studies suggest that bacteria influence the pathogenesis of primary colorectal cancer (CRC), yet their role in recurrence after resection is largely unknown. We have discovered that collagenase-producing bacteria promote cancer recurrence in mice, and that antibiotic bowel decontamination decreases colonization of these same organisms in humans. We hypothesized that preoperative combined mechanical and oral antibiotic bowel preparation would improve disease-free survival (DFS) in patients undergoing surgery for CRC.

## Exploring Gut Microbiota in Patients with Colorectal Disease Based on 16S rRNA Gene Amplicon and Shallow Metagenomic Sequencing.
 27.07.2021, _Y Liu, X Li, Y Yang, Y Liu, S Wang, B Ji, Y Wei_


The gastrointestinal tract, the largest human microbial reservoir, is highly dynamic. The gut microbes play essential roles in causing colorectal diseases. In the present study, we explored potential keystone taxa during the development of colorectal diseases in central China. Fecal samples of some patients were collected and were allocated to the adenoma (Group A), colorectal cancer (Group C), and hemorrhoid (Group H) groups. The 16S rRNA amplicon and shallow metagenomic sequencing (SMS) strategies were used to recover the gut microbiota. Microbial diversities obtained from 16S rRNA amplicon and SMS data were similar. Group C had the highest diversity, although no significant difference in diversity was observed among the groups. The most dominant phyla in the gut microbiota of patients with colorectal diseases were Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria, accounting for &gt;95% of microbes in the samples. The most abundant genera in the samples were Bacteroides, Prevotella, and Escherichia/Shigella, and further species-level and network analyses identified certain potential keystone taxa in each group. Some of the dominant species, such as Prevotella copri, Bacteroides dorei, and Bacteroides vulgatus, could be responsible for causing colorectal diseases. The SMS data recovered diverse antibiotic resistance genes of tetracycline, macrolide, and beta-lactam, which could be a result of antibiotic overuse. This study explored the gut microbiota of patients with three different types of colorectal diseases, and the microbial diversity results obtained from 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and SMS data were found to be similar. However, the findings of this study are based on a limited sample size, which warrants further large-scale studies. The recovery of gut microbiota profiles in patients with colorectal diseases could be beneficial for future diagnosis and treatment with modulation of the gut microbiota. Moreover, SMS data can provide accurate species- and gene-level information, and it is economical. It can therefore be widely applied in future clinical metagenomic studies.

## The Intestinal Microbiome Predicts Weight Loss on a Calorie-Restricted Diet and Is Associated With Improved Hepatic Steatosis.
 27.07.2021, _TS Dong, K Luu, V Lagishetty, F Sedighian, SL Woo, BW Dreskin, W Katzka, C Chang, Y Zhou, N Arias-Jayo, J Yang, AI Ahdoot, J Ye, Z Li, JR Pisegna, JP Jacobs_


Background: The microbiome has been shown in pre-clinical and epidemiological studies to be important in both the development and treatment of obesity and metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). However, few studies have examined the role of the microbiome in the clinical response to calorie restriction. To explore this area, we performed a prospective study examining the association of the intestinal microbiome with weight loss and change in hepatic steatosis on a calorie-restricted diet. Methods: A prospective dietary intervention study of 80 overweight and obese participants was performed at the Greater West Los Angeles Veterans Affair Hospital. Patients were placed on a macronutrient standardized diet for 16 weeks, including 14 weeks of calorie restriction (500 calorie deficit). Body composition analysis by impedance, plasma lipid measurements, and ultrasound elastography to measure hepatic steatosis were performed at baseline and week 16. Intestinal microbiome composition was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. A per protocol analysis was performed on all subjects completing the trial (n = 46). Results: Study completers showed significant reduction in weight, body mass index, total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein, and triglyceride. Subjects who lost at least 5% of their body weight had significantly greater reduction in serum triglyceride and hepatic steatosis than those with &lt;5% body weight loss. Enterococcus and Klebsiella were reduced at the end of the trial while Coprococcus and Collinsella were increased. There were also significant baseline microbiome differences between patients who had at least 5% weight loss as compared to those that did not. Lachnoclostridium was positively associated with hepatic steatosis and Actinomyces was positively associated with hepatic steatosis and weight. Baseline microbiome profiles were able to predict which patients lost at least 5% of their body weight with an AUROC of 0.80. Conclusion: Calorie restriction alters the intestinal microbiome and improves hepatic steatosis in those who experience significant weight loss. Baseline microbiome differences predict weight loss on a calorie-restricted diet and are associated with improvement in hepatic steatosis, suggesting a role of the gut microbiome in mediating the clinical response to calorie restriction.

## Analyses of publicly available Hungatella hathewayi genomes revealed genetic distances indicating they belong to more than one species.
 26.07.2021, _LE Hernández-Juárez, M Camorlinga, A Méndez-Tenorio, JF Calderón, BC Huang, DDR Bandoy, BC Weimer, J Torres_


Hungatella hathewayi has been observed to be a member of the gut microbiome. Unfortunately, little is known about this organism in spite of being associated with human fatalities; it is important to understand virulence mechanisms and epidemiological prospective to cause disease. In this study, a patient with chronic neurologic symptoms presented to the clinic with subsequent isolation of a strain with phenotypic characteristics suggestive of Clostridium difficile. However, whole-genome sequence found the organism to be H. hathewayi. Analysis including publicly available Hungatella genomes found substantial genomic differences as compared to the type strain, indicating this isolate was not C. difficile. We examined the whole-genome of Hungatella species and related genera, using comparative genomics to fully examine species identification and toxin production. Orthogonal phylogenetic using the 16S rRNA gene and entire genome analyses that included genome distance analyses using Genome-to-Genome Distance (GGDC), Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI), and a pan-genome analysis with inclusion of available public genomes determined the speciation to be Hungatella. Two clearly differentiated groups were identified, one including a reference H. hathewayi genome (strain DSM-13,479) and a second group that was determined to be H. effluvii, which included our clinical isolate. Also, some genomes reported as H. hathewayi were found to belong to other genera, including Clostridium and Faecalicatena. We show that the Hungatella species have an open pan-genome reflecting high genomic diversity. This study highlights the importance of correctly assigning taxonomic identification, particularly in disease-associated strains, to better understand virulence and therapeutic options.

## Estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα) is a key regulator of intestinal homeostasis and protects against colitis.
 26.07.2021, _A Tran, C Scholtes, M Songane, C Champagne, L Galarneau, MP Levasseur, N Fodil, CR Dufour, V Giguère, M Saleh_


The estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα) is a primary regulator of mitochondrial energy metabolism, function and dynamics, and has been implicated in autophagy and immune regulation. ERRα is abundantly expressed in the intestine and in cells of the immune system. However, its role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains unknown. Here, we report a protective role of ERRα in the intestine. We found that mice deficient in ERRα were susceptible to experimental colitis, exhibiting increased colon inflammation and tissue damage. This phenotype was mediated by impaired compensatory proliferation of intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) following injury, enhanced IEC apoptosis and necrosis and reduced mucus-producing goblet cell counts. Longitudinal analysis of the microbiota demonstrated that loss of ERRα lead to a reduction in microbiome α-diversity and depletion of healthy gut bacterial constituents. Mechanistically, ERRα mediated its protective effects by acting within the radio-resistant compartment of the intestine. It promoted disease tolerance through transcriptional control of key genes involved in intestinal tissue homeostasis and repair. These findings provide new insights on the role of ERRα in the gut and extends our current knowledge of nuclear receptors implicated in IBD.

## Human milk oligosaccharide 2'-fucosyllactose supplementation improves gut barrier function and signaling in the vagal afferent pathway in mice.
 26.07.2021, _S Lee, ML Goodson, W Vang, J Rutkowsky, K Kalanetra, M Bhattacharya, D Barile, HE Raybould_


2'-Fucosyllactose (2'-FL) is one of the predominant oligosaccharides found in human milk and has several well-established beneficial effects in the host. It has previously been shown that 2'-FL can improve the metabolic phenotype in high-fat (HF)-fed mice. Here we investigated whether dietary supplementation with 2'-FL was associated with improved intestinal barrier integrity, signaling in the vagal afferent pathway and cognitive function. Mice were fed either a low-fat (LF, 10% fat per kcal) or HF (45% fat per kcal) diet with or without supplementation of 2'-FL (10% w/w) in the diet for 8 weeks. Body weight, energy intake, fat and lean mass, intestinal permeability (ex vivo in Ussing chambers), lipid profiles, gut microbiome and microbial metabolites, and cognitive functions were measured. Vagal afferent activity was measured via immunohistochemical detection of c-Fos protein in the brainstem in response to peripheral administration of cholecystokinin (CCK). 2'-FL significantly attenuated the HF-induced increase in fat mass and energy intake. 2'-FL significantly reduced intestinal permeability and significantly increased expression of interleukin (IL)-22, a cytokine known for its protective role in the intestine. Additionally, 2'-FL led to changes in the gut microbiota composition and in the associated microbial metabolites. Signaling in the vagal afferent pathway was improved but there was no effect on cognitive function. In conclusion, 2'-FL supplementation improved the metabolic profiles, gut barrier integrity, lipid metabolism and signaling in the vagal afferent pathway. These findings support the utility of 2'-FL in the control of gut barrier function and metabolic homeostasis under a metabolic challenge.

## Dietary supplementation of alpha-lipoic acid mitigates the negative effects of heat stress in broilers.
 26.07.2021, _S Wasti, N Sah, CN Lee, R Jha, B Mishra_


Heat stress accounts for substantial economic loss in the poultry industry by altering the health and performance of chickens. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a water and fat-soluble antioxidant which is readily absorbed from the intestine resulting in maximum bioavailability. Moreover, ALA acts as a coenzyme in glucose metabolism and helps generate other antioxidants. Considering these benefits, we hypothesized that dietary supplementation of ALA would help mitigate heat stress in poultry. A total of 72 Day-old broiler chicks were randomly assigned into three treatment groups: no heat stress (NHS), heat stress with basal diet (HS), and heat stress with alpha-lipoic acid (HS+ALA); each treatment group had 6 replicate pens with 4 birds in each pen (n = 24/group). The allocated birds were raised under standard husbandry practices for 3 weeks. After 21 d, birds in the HS and HS+ALA groups were exposed to heat stress (33°C for 8 hours during the day) for 3 weeks, while the NHS group was reared under normal conditions (22-24°C). The HS+ALA group received a basal finisher diet fortified with ALA (500 mg/kg) during the treatment period (22 to 42 d), while other birds were provided with the basal finisher diet. Weekly body weight and feed intake were recorded. The cecum digesta for volatile fatty acids (VFAs) analysis and 16S rRNA sequencing for the gut microbiota analysis; and the ileum tissue samples for histological and gene expression analyses were collected on d 42. Exposure to heat stress decreased (P&lt;0.05) average daily gain (ADG) and final body weight (FBW) in the HS group compared to the NHS group, the supplementation of ALA improved (P&lt;0.05) ADG and FBW in heat-stressed birds. Furthermore, birds in the HS+ALA group had increased (P&lt;0.05) expression of HSP90, PRDX1, GPX3, SOD2, OCLN, and MUC2 genes and higher (P&lt;0.05) concentrations of major VFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate). The dietary ALA supplementation also improved the villus height and villus height to crypt depth ratio in the HS+ALA group. The microbial diversity analysis revealed significant abundance (P&lt;0.05) of beneficial bacteria Lactobacillus and Peptostreptococcaceae in the cecum of the ALA group. These results indicate that dietary ALA supplementation effectively mitigates the negative effects of heat stress in broilers by improving the expression of heat-shock, tight-junction, antioxidants, and immune-related genes in the intestine, improving villus structures, increasing concentration of major VFAs, and enriching the beneficial microbiota.

## On the move: sloths and their epibionts as model mobile ecosystems.
 26.07.2021, _M Kaup, S Trull, EFY Hom_


Sloths are unusual mobile ecosystems, containing a high diversity of epibionts living and growing in their fur as they climb slowly through the canopies of tropical forests. These epibionts include poorly studied algae, arthropods, fungi, and bacteria, making sloths likely reservoirs of unexplored biodiversity. This review aims to identify gaps and eliminate misconceptions in our knowledge of sloths and their epibionts, and to identify key questions to stimulate future research into the functions and roles of sloths within a broader ecological and evolutionary context. This review also seeks to position the sloth fur ecosystem as a model for addressing fundamental questions in metacommunity and movement ecology. The conceptual and evidence-based foundation of this review aims to serve as a guide for future hypothesis-driven research into sloths, their microbiota, sloth health and conservation, and the coevolution of symbioses in general.

## The discovery of pivotal fungus and major determinant factor shaping soil microbial community composition associated with rot root of American ginseng.
 26.07.2021, _L Tian, J Ou, X Sun, Y Miao, J Pei, L Zhao, L Huang_


American ginseng, a valuable medicinal and food plant, is threatened by rot root, which affects its yield and quality. However, limited studies have investigated the changes in soil microbial community and physiochemical properties between healthy and rot root American ginseng. Here, high-throughput sequencing and soil physiochemical properties were used to characterize these changes. The soil physiochemical properties showed significance differences between the soil of healthy and rot root, in which the pH, available potassium, available phosphorus, soil organic carbon and soil organic matter were significantly higher in healthy root soil. Besides, fungal α-diversity was also higher in healthy root soil than that in rot root. Importantly, the dominant fungal genera differed between soils of healthy and rot root of American ginseng, and LEfSe further indicated that six fungal genera (Devriesia, Chrysosporium, Dichotomopilus, Pseudeurotium, Acaulium and Scedosporium) were significantly enriched in the soil of healthy plants, whereas six fungal genera (Gibellulopsis, Fusarium, Plectosphaerella, Tetracladium, Gibberella and Ilyonectri) were significantly enriched in the soil of rot root, suggesting that an increase in the relative abundance of these pathogenic fungi (Fusarium, Plectosphaerella, and Ilyonectri) may be associated with ginseng rot root. Notably, this study is the first to report that an increase in the relative abundances of Gibellulopsis and Gibberella in the rot root soil of American ginseng may be associated with the onset of rot root symptoms in this plant. The functional profile prediction showed that the there was a significantly Pathotrophs increase in the rot root soil compared with healthy root soil and Saprotrophs were more abundant in the healthy root soil. Finally, correlation analyses revealed that soil cation exchange capacity was an important factors affecting the composition of rot root of American ginseng soil microbial communities. This study not only used a new approach to explore the new fungal associated with rot root in American ginseng but also excavated the major soil physiochemical properties affecting the microbiome diversity, providing foundation for developing biocontrol strategies against rot root.

## Description of Microbial Communities of Phosphate Mine Wastes in Morocco, a Semi-Arid Climate, Using High-Throughput Sequencing and Functional Prediction.
 27.07.2021, _N Mghazli, L Sbabou, R Hakkou, A Ouhammou, M El Adnani, O Bruneel_


Soil microbiota are vital for successful revegetation, as they play a critical role in nutrient cycles, soil functions, and plant growth and health. A rehabilitation scenario of the abandoned Kettara mine (Morocco) includes covering acidic tailings with alkaline phosphate mine wastes to limit water infiltration and hence acid mine drainage. Revegetation of phosphate wastes is the final step to this rehabilitation plan. However, revegetation is hard on this type of waste in semi-arid areas and only a few plants managed to grow naturally after 5 years on the store-and-release cover. As we know that belowground biodiversity is a key component for aboveground functioning, we sought to know if any structural problem in phosphate waste communities could explain the almost absence of plants. To test this hypothesis, bacterial and archaeal communities present in these wastes were assessed by 16S rRNA metabarcoding. Exploration of taxonomic composition revealed a quite diversified community assigned to 19 Bacterial and two Archaeal phyla, similar to other studies, that do not appear to raise any particular issues of structural problems. The dominant sequences belonged to Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Gemmatimonadetes and to the genera Massilia, Sphingomonas, and Adhaeribacter. LEfSe analysis identified 19 key genera, and metagenomic functional prediction revealed a broader phylogenetic range of taxa than expected, with all identified genera possessing at least one plant growth-promoting trait. Around 47% of the sequences were also related to genera possessing strains that facilitate plant development under biotic and environmental stress conditions, such as drought and heat.

## Dynamics of bacterial and archaeal communities along the composting of tannery sludge.
 25.07.2021, _ASF Araujo, APA de Pereira, JEL Antunes, LMS Oliveira, WJ de Melo, SMB Rocha, MR do Amorim, FF Araujo, VMM Melo, LW Mendes_


The process of composting has been proposed as a biological alternative to improve the quality of tannery sludge (TS) by the action of microbial communities. However, there is limited knowledge about the dynamic of these microbial communities during the composting process. This study assessed the responses of bacterial and archaeal communities during TS composting using the 16S rRNA sequencing. The composting process occurred within 90 days, and samples of compost were collected on day 7 (d7; mesophilic stage), 30 (d30; thermophilic stage), 60 (d60; cooling stage), and 90 (d90; maturation stage). The results showed a succession of microbial phyla during the composting with enrichment of Synergistetes, WS1, and Euryarchaeota at the mesophilic stage, while at the thermophilic stage, there was an enrichment of Hydrogenedentes, WPS-2, Chloroflexi, and Deinococcus-Thermus. At the cooling stage, there was an enrichment of Kiritimatiellaeota, and at the maturation stage, there was an enrichment of Entotheonellaeota, Dadabacteria, Nitrospirae, Dependiatiae, and Fibrobacteres. When analyzing the drivers influencing microbial communities, Cr and pH presented more negative correlations with general phyla. In contrast, S, C, K, temperature, and N presented more positive correlations, while Ni, Cd, and P showed fewer correlations. According to niche occupancy, we observed a decreased proportion of generalists with a consequently increased proportion of specialists following the composting process. This study showed that different stages of the composting present a specific microbial community structure and dynamics, which are related to some specific composting characteristics.

The phylogenetic diversity and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) of Campylobacter coli from humans and animals in Japan between 2008 and 2014 were investigated. A total of 338 foodborne campylobacterioses were reported in Osaka, and C. coli was isolated from 38 cases (11.2%). In the present study, 119 C. coli strains (42 from humans, 25 each from poultry, cattle, and swine, and 2 from wild mallard) were examined by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). MLST assigned 36 sequence types (STs), including 14 novel STs; all human strains and 91% of animal strains (70/77) were assigned to the ST-828 clonal complex. The predominant human ST was ST-860 (18/42, 43%), followed by ST-1068 (8/42, 19%); these STs were also predominant in poultry (ST-860, 9/25, 36%) and cattle (ST-1068, 18/25, 72%). ST-1562 was only predominant in swine (11/25, 44.0%). Swine strains showed the greatest resistance to erythromycin (EM; 92.0%), while EM resistance was only found in 2 out of the 42 human strains examined (4.8%). All EM-resistant swine strains (n=15) exhibited a common point mutation in the 23S rRNA sequence (A2085G), and the tetO gene was detected in 22 out of the 23 TET-resistant swine strains. A whole genome sequencing analysis of four representative swine ST-1562 strains revealed abundant AMR-associated gene clusters in their genomes, suggesting horizontal gene transfer events during host adaptation. This is the first study to demonstrate the phylogenetic diversity and AMR profiles of C. coli in Japan. The present results suggest that poultry and cattle are major reservoirs, improving our knowledge on the epidemiological and ecological traits of this pathogen.

## Strainberry: automated strain separation in low-complexity metagenomes using long reads.
 26.07.2021, _R Vicedomini, C Quince, AE Darling, R Chikhi_


High-throughput short-read metagenomics has enabled large-scale species-level analysis and functional characterization of microbial communities. Microbiomes often contain multiple strains of the same species, and different strains have been shown to have important differences in their functional roles. Recent advances on long-read based methods enabled accurate assembly of bacterial genomes from complex microbiomes and an as-yet-unrealized opportunity to resolve strains. Here we present Strainberry, a metagenome assembly pipeline that performs strain separation in single-sample low-complexity metagenomes and that relies uniquely on long-read data. We benchmarked Strainberry on mock communities for which it produces strain-resolved assemblies with near-complete reference coverage and 99.9% base accuracy. We also applied Strainberry on real datasets for which it improved assemblies generating 20-118% additional genomic material than conventional metagenome assemblies on individual strain genomes. We show that Strainberry is also able to refine microbial diversity in a complex microbiome, with complete separation of strain genomes. We anticipate this work to be a starting point for further methodological improvements on strain-resolved metagenome assembly in environments of higher complexities.

## Visualization of Gut Microbiota-host Interactions via Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization, Lectin Staining, and Imaging.
 27.07.2021, _KM Ng, C Tropini_


Measuring the localization of microbes within their in vivo context is an essential step in revealing the functional relationships between the microbiota and the vertebrate gut. The spatial landscape of the gut microbiota is tightly controlled by physical features - intestinal mucus, crypts, and folds - and is affected by host-controlled properties such as pH, oxygen availability, and immune factors. These properties limit the ability of commensal microbes and pathogens alike to colonize the gut stably. At the micron-scale, microbial organization determines the close-range interactions between different microbes as well as the interactions between microbes and their host. These interactions then affect large-scale organ function and host health. This protocol enables the visualization of the gut microbiota spatial organization from distances between cells to organ-wide scales. The method is based on fixing gut tissues while preserving intestinal structure and mucus properties. The fixed samples are then embedded, sectioned, and stained to highlight specific bacterial species through fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Host features, such as mucus and host cell components, are labeled with fluorescently labeled lectins. Finally, the stained sections are imaged using a confocal microscope utilizing tile-scan imaging at high magnification to bridge the micron to centimeter length scales. This type of imaging can be applied to intestinal sections from animal models and biopsies from human tissues to determine the biogeography of the microbiota in the gut in health and disease.

## A protocol for characterization of extremely preterm infant gut microbiota in double-blind clinical trials.
 27.07.2021, _M Martí, JE Spreckels, MC Jenmalm, T Abrahamsson_


16S rRNA gene sequencing enables microbial community profiling, but recovering fecal DNA from extremely premature infants is challenging. Here, we describe an optimized protocol for fecal DNA isolation, library preparation for 16S rRNA gene sequencing, taxonomy assignation, and statistical analyses. The protocol is complemented with a quantitative PCR for probiotic L. reuteri identification. This protocol describes how to characterize preterm infant gut microbiota and relate it to probiotic supplementation and clinical outcomes. It is customizable for other clinical trials. For complete details on the use and execution of this protocol, please refer to Martí et al. (2021) and Spreckels et al. (2021).

## Transformation and differential abundance analysis of microbiome data incorporating phylogeny.
 24.07.2021, _C Zhou, H Zhao, T Wang_


Microbiome data have proven extremely useful for understanding microbial communities and their impacts in health and disease. Although microbiome analysis methods and standards are evolving rapidly, obtaining meaningful and interpretable results from microbiome studies still requires careful statistical treatment. In particular, many existing and emerging methods for differential abundance analysis fail to account for the fact that microbiome data are high-dimensional and sparse, compositional, negatively and positively correlated, and phylogenetically structured. To better describe microbiome data and improve the power of differential abundance testing, there is still a great need for the continued development of appropriate statistical methodology.
