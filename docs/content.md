Immunotherapy utilizing chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy holds promise for hematologic malignancies, however, response rates and associated immune-related adverse effects widely vary among patients. Here we show, by comparing diversity and composition of the gut microbiome during different CAR-T therapeutic phases in the clinical trial ChiCTR1800017404, that the gut flora characteristically differs among patients and according to treatment stages, and might also reflect patient response to therapy in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM; n = 43), acute lympholastic leukemia (ALL; n = 23) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL; n = 12). We observe significant temporal differences in diversity and abundance of Bifidobacterium, Prevotella, Sutterella, and Collinsella between MM patients in complete remission (n = 24) and those in partial remission (n = 11). Furthermore, we find that patients with severe cytokine release syndrome present with higher abundance of Bifidobacterium, Leuconostoc, Stenotrophomonas, and Staphylococcus, which is reproducible in an independent cohort of 38 MM patients. This study has important implications for understanding the biological role of the microbiome in CAR-T treatment responsiveness of hematologic malignancy patients, and may guide therapeutic intervention to increase efficacy. The success rate of CAR-T cell therapy is high in blood cancers, yet individual patient characteristics might reduce therapeutic benefit. Here we show that therapeutic response in MM, ALL and NHL, and occurrence of severe cytokine release syndrome in multiple myeloma are associated with specific gut microbiome alterations.

Recent pandemic infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) led the scientific community to investigate the possible causes contributing to the physiopathology of this disease. In this context, analyses of the intestinal microbiota highlighted possible correlation between host-associated bacterial communities and development of the COVID-19. Nevertheless, a detailed investigation of the role of the human microbiota in the severity of the symptoms of this disease is still lacking. This study performed a comprehensive meta-analysis of 323 fecal samples from public and novel Italian data sets based on the shotgun metagenomic approach. In detail, the comparative analyses revealed possible differences in the microbial biodiversity related to the individual health status, highlighting a species richness decrease in COVID-19 patients with a severe prognosis. Moreover, healthy subjects resulted characterized by a higher abundance of protective and health-supporting bacterial species, while patients affected by COVID-19 disease displayed a significant increase of opportunistic pathogen bacteria involved in developing putrefactive dysbiosis. Furthermore, prediction of the microbiome functional capabilities suggested that individuals affected by COVID-19 subsist in an unbalanced metabolism characterized by an overrepresentation of enzymes involved in the protein metabolism at the expense of carbohydrates-oriented pathways, which can impact on disease severity and in excessive systemic inflammation.

Oral rotavirus vaccine efficacy is lower in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) than in high-income countries. The degree to which antibiotic use impacts rotavirus vaccine immunogenicity in LMICs is unknown. Using data from a multisite prospective birth cohort study of malnutrition and enteric disease, MAL-ED, we examined the effect of early life antibiotic use on the immune response to rotavirus vaccine.

## Crucial nuances in understanding (mis)associations between the neonatal microbiome and Cesarean delivery.
 09.09.2022, _AM Sassin, GJ Johnson, AN Goulding, KM Aagaard_


As rates of Cesarean delivery and common non-communicable disorders (NCDs), such as obesity, metabolic disease, and atopy/asthma, have concomitantly increased in recent decades, investigators have attempted to discern a causal link. One line of research has led to a hypothesis that Cesarean birth disrupts the presumed normal process of colonization of the neonatal microbiome with vaginal microbes, yielding NCDs later in life. However, a direct link between a disrupted microbiota transfer at time of delivery and acute and/or chronic illness in infants born via Cesarean has not been causally established. Microbiota seeding from maternal vaginal or stool sources has been preliminarily evaluated as an intervention designed to compensate for the lack of (or limited) exposure to such sources among Cesarean-delivered neonates. However, to date, clinical trials have yet to show a clear health benefit with neonatal 'vaginal seeding' practices. Until the long-term effects of these microbiome alterations can be fully determined, it is paramount to conduct parallel meaningful and mechanistic-minded interrogations of the impact of clinically modifiable maternal, nutritional, or environmental exposure on the functional microbiome over the duration of pregnancy and lactation to determine their role in the mitigation of childhood and adult NCDs.

## L-Theanine regulates lipid metabolism by modulating gut microbiota and bile acid metabolism.
 10.09.2022, _W Xu, Y Kong, T Zhang, Z Gong, W Xiao_


L-theanine (LTA) is a biologically active ingredient in tea that shows great potential for regulating lipid metabolism. Bile acids (BA), an important end-product of cholesterol catabolism, participate in the regulation of lipid metabolism and gut microbiota. Here, we investigated the effect of LTA on lipid metabolism and the mechanism by which it regulates BA metabolism and gut microbiota. Male BALB/c mice were treated with LTA for 28 d.

## Exposure to dechlorane 602 induces perturbation of gut immunity and microbiota in female mice.
 10.09.2022, _Y Li, TL Guo, HQ Xie, L Xu, Y Liu, L Zheng, S Yu, G Chen, J Ji, S Jiang, D Xu, X Hang, B Zhao_


The homeostasis of gut immunity and microbiota are associated with the health of the gut. Dechlorane 602 (Dec 602) with food web magnification potential has been detected in daily food. People who were orally exposed to Dec 602 may encounter increased risk of health problems in the gut. In order to reveal the influence of short-term exposure of Dec 602 on gut immunity and microbiota, adult female C57BL/6 mice were administered orally with Dec 602 (low/high doses: 1.0/10.0 μg/kg body weight per day) for 7 days. Lymphocytes were examined by flow cytometry. Gut microbiota was measured by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Results showed that fecal IgA was upregulated after exposure to the high dose of Dec 602, suggesting that there might be inflammation in the gut. Then, changes of immune cells in mesenteric lymph nodes and colonic lamina propria were examined. We found that exposure to the high dose of Dec 602 decreased the percentages of the anti-inflammatory T regulatory cells in mesenteric lymph nodes. In colonic lamina propria, the production of gut protective cytokine interleukin-22 by CD4+ T cells was decreased, and a decreased trend of interleukin-22 production was also observed in type 3 innate lymphoid cells in the high dose group. Furthermore, an altered microbiota composition toward inflammation in the gut was observed after exposure to Dec 602. Additionally, the altered microbiota correlated with changes of immune parameters, suggesting that there were interactions between influenced microbiota and immune parameters after exposure to Dec 602. Taken together, short-term exposure to Dec 602 induced gut immunity and microbiota perturbations, and this might be the mechanisms for Dec 602 to elicit inflammation in the gut.

## Dynamics of bacterial and fungal communities of mango: From the tree to ready-to-Eat products.

Processing, such as fresh cutting and drying, is essential to enhance profitability; therefore, to limit waste and reduce losses in fruit production such as mangoes. Metabarcoding and microbial enumeration methods were utilized to explore the structure of mango microbiota, as well as their evolution after processing. Two mango ripening stages of cv. Cogshall were selected and processed into fresh-cut pieces or dried slices. Microbiological and physicochemical parameters were monitored during product storage, in order to assess the dynamics of quantitative and qualitative variations of the microbial flora. Proteobacteria was the dominant bacterial phylum of the mango surface and accounted for 73.16%, followed by Actinobacteria (10.16%), Bacteroidetes (7.82%) and Firmicutes (6.68%). Aureobasidium and Cladosporium were the only two genera shared between all types of samples (peel surface, dried slices and mango fresh-cut). However, the bacterial genera Lactobacillus and Pantoea were the most abundant in fresh-cut mango after 14 days of storage. Ascomycota was the dominant fungal phylum in the mango surface and accounted for 90.76% of the total number of detected sequences, followed by Basidiomycota (9.21%). In total, 866 microbial genera were associated with mango surface (562 bacterial and 304 fungal). Among detected yeast genera, Saccharomyces, Candida and Malassezia prevailed in mango flesh and were replaced by Wickerhamomyces after 14 days of storage. Alpha and beta diversity analyzes revealed differences in fungal and bacterial communities on fruit peel, in fresh-cut, dried slices, and during conservation (fresh-cut and dried slices). Mango processing (washing, peeling, cutting and drying) reduced the richness and the microbial diversity (bacterial and fungal) associated to the fruit, and drying limits the development of cultivable microorganisms during storage in comparison to fresh-cuts mangoes.

## The microbiome of fly organs and fly-human microbial transfer during decomposition.
 10.09.2022, _HL Deel, S Montoya, K King, AL Emmons, C Huhn, AM Lynne, JL Metcalf, SR Bucheli_


During decomposition, flies interact with the remains to lay eggs and acquire nutrients, and in the process, they bring their microbes with them. While it is known that flies have their own unique core microbiome, it is not known if flies associated with human cadavers have a different core microbiome. Differences in the fly microbiome may influence the types of microbes transmitted from the flies to the cadaver, therefore potentially affecting assembly of the human decomposer microbiome. The first purpose of this study was to characterize the microbiome of flies associated with human cadavers by fly organ and season. This is because fly interactions with cadavers vary by season, and because it is likely that external fly organs [i.e., the labellum and tarsi] make more direct contact and are likely involved in increased mechanical transmission with the cadaver than internal organs such as the oocyte. The second purpose of this study was to determine if the fly microbes contribute to the human decomposer microbiome. To accomplish these aims, 10 human cadavers were placed outdoors across three seasons and allowed to decompose. A total of 40 flies that landed on the cadaver were collected and dissected by the labellum, tarsi, and oocyte. In addition to fly collections, samples from the cadavers were collected using a sterile swab at sites including the cheek of the face, inner cheek, bicep, torso, and anus. Overall, it was shown that flies associated with human cadavers have a similar microbiome to flies from previous studies that were not associated with human cadavers. However, there are differences in the microbiome between seasons and fly parts. We also show evidence that flies act as a microbial source to the human decomposer microbiome, which is important for understanding the ecological mechanisms of human cadaver microbial community assembly.
