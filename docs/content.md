Restriction of methionine (MR), a sulfur-containing essential amino acid, has been reported to repress cancer growth and improve therapeutic responses in several preclinical settings. However, how MR impacts cancer progression in the context of the intact immune system is unknown. Here we report that while inhibiting cancer growth in immunocompromised mice, MR reduces T cell abundance, exacerbates tumour growth and impairs tumour response to immunotherapy in immunocompetent male and female mice. Mechanistically, MR reduces microbial production of hydrogen sulfide, which is critical for immune cell survival/activation. Dietary supplementation of a hydrogen sulfide donor or a precursor, or methionine, stimulates antitumour immunity and suppresses tumour progression. Our findings reveal an unexpected negative interaction between MR, sulfur deficiency and antitumour immunity and further uncover a vital role of gut microbiota in mediating this interaction. Our study suggests that any possible anticancer benefits of MR require careful consideration of both the microbiota and the immune system.

Head and neck cancers are a complex malignancy comprising multiple anatomical sites, with cancer of the oral cavity ranking among the deadliest and the most disfiguring cancers globally. Oral cancer (OC) constitutes a subset of head and neck cancer cases, presenting primarily as tobacco- and alcohol-associated oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), with a 5-year survival rate of ~ 65%, partly due to the lack of early detection and effective treatments. OSCC arises from premalignant lesions (PMLs) in the oral cavity through a multi-step series of clinical and histopathological stages, including varying degrees of epithelial dysplasia. To gain insights into the molecular mechanisms associated with the progression of PMLs to OSCC, we profiled the whole transcriptome of 66 human PMLs comprising leukoplakia with dysplasia and hyperkeratosis non-reactive (HkNR) pathologies, alongside healthy controls and OSCC. Our data revealed that PMLs were enriched in gene signatures associated with cellular plasticity, such as partial EMT (p-EMT) phenotypes, and with immune response. Integrated analyses of the host transcriptome and microbiome further highlighted a significant association between differential microbial abundance and PML pathway activity, suggesting a contribution of the oral microbiome toward PML evolution to OSCC. Collectively, this study reveals molecular processes associated with PML progression that may help early diagnosis and disease interception at an early stage.

## Metagenomics revealed a correlation of gut phageome with autism spectrum disorder.
 07.08.2023, _K Shahin, A Soleimani-Delfan, Z He, P Sansonetti, JM Collard_


The human gut bacteriome is believed to have pivotal influences on human health and disease while the particular roles associated with the gut phageome have not been fully characterized yet with few exceptions. It is argued that gut microbiota can have a potential role in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The public microbiota database of ASD and typically developing (TD) Chinese individuals were analyzed for phage protein-coding units (pPCU) to find any link between the phageome and ASD. The gut phageome of ASD individuals showed a wider diversity and higher abundance compared to TD individuals. The ASD phageome was associated with a significant expansion of Caudoviricetes bacteriophages. Phages infecting Bacteroidaceae and prophages encoded within Faecalibacterium were more frequent in ASD than in TD individuals. The expansion and diversification of ASD phageome can influence the bacterial homeostasis by imposing pressure on the bacterial communities. In conclusion, the differences of phages community in in ASD and TD can be used as potential diagnosis biomarkers of ASD. Further investigations are needed to verify the role of gut phage communities in the pathogenesis of ASD.

The cervicovaginal microbiota is influenced by host physiology, immunology, lifestyle, and ethnicity. We hypothesized that there would be differences in the cervicovaginal microbiota among pregnant, nonpregnant, and menopausal women living in Puerto Rico (PR) with and without human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and cervical cancer. We specifically wanted to determine if the microbiota is associated with variations in cervical cytology. A total of 294 women, including reproductive-age nonpregnant (N = 196), pregnant (N = 37), and menopausal (N = 61) women, were enrolled. The cervicovaginal bacteria were characterized by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, the HPV was genotyped with SPF10-LiPA, and cervical cytology was quantified. High-risk HPV (HR-HPV, 67.3%) was prevalent, including genotypes not covered by the 9vt HPV vaccine. Cervical lesions (34%) were also common. The cervical microbiota was dominated by Lactobacillus iners. Pregnant women in the second and third trimesters exhibited a decrease in diversity and abundance of microbes associated with bacterial vaginosis. Women in menopause had greater alpha diversity, a greater proportion of facultative and strictly anaerobic bacteria, and higher cervicovaginal pH than premenopausal women. Cervical lesions were associated with greater alpha diversity. However, no significant associations between the microbiota and HPV infection (HR or LR-HPV types) were found. The cervicovaginal microbiota of women living in Puerto Rican were either dominated by L. iners or diverse microbial communities regardless of a woman's physiological stage. We postulate that the microbiota and the high prevalence of HR-HPV increase the risk of cervical lesions among women living in PR. IMPORTANCE In the enclosed manuscript, we provide the first in-depth characterization of the cervicovaginal microbiota of Hispanic women living in Puerto Rico (PR), using a 16S rRNA approach, and include women of different physiological stages. Surprisingly we found that high-risk HPV was ubiquitous with a prevalence of 67.3%, including types not covered by the 9vt HPV vaccine. We also found highly diverse microbial communities across women groups-with a reduction in pregnant women, but dominated by nonoptimal Lactobacillus iners. Additionally, we found vaginosis-associated bacteria as Dialister spp., Gardnerella spp., Clostridium, or Prevotella among most women. We believe this is a relevant and timely article expanding knowledge on the cervicovaginal microbiome of PR women, where we postulate that these highly diverse communities are conducive to cervical disease.

## Illuminating the Oral Microbiome: Cellular Microbiology.
 03.08.2023, _RJ Lamont, DP Miller, J Bagaitkar_


Epithelial cells line mucosal surfaces such as in the gingival crevice and provide a barrier to the ingress of colonizing microorganisms. However, epithelial cells are more than a passive barrier to microbial intrusion, and rather constitute an interactive interface with colonizing organisms which senses the composition of the microbiome and communicates this information to the underlying cells of the innate immune system. Microorganisms, for their part, have devised means to manipulate host cell signal transduction pathways to favor their colonization and survival. Study of this field, which has become known as cellular microbiology, has revealed much about epithelial cell physiology, bacterial colonization and pathogenic strategies, and innate host responses.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic hemolytic anemia that may be life-threatening due to multisystemic effects. Identification of the factors which affect the pathophysiology of the disease is important in reducing mortality and morbidity. This study aimed to determine gut microbial diversity in children and adolescents with SCA compared with healthy volunteers and to evaluate the clinical impact of microbiota.

## Genetic and gut microbiome determinants of SCFA circulating and fecal levels, postprandial responses and links to chronic and acute inflammation.

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) are involved in immune system and inflammatory responses. We comprehensively assessed the host genetic and gut microbial contribution to a panel of eight serum and stool SCFAs in two cohorts (TwinsUK, n = 2507; ZOE PREDICT-1, n = 328), examined their postprandial changes and explored their links with chronic and acute inflammatory responses in healthy individuals and trauma patients. We report low concordance between circulating and fecal SCFAs, significant postprandial changes in most circulating SCFAs, and a heritable genetic component (average h2: serum = 14%(SD = 14%); stool = 12%(SD = 6%)). Furthermore, we find that gut microbiome can accurately predict their fecal levels (AUC&gt;0.71) while presenting weaker associations with serum. Finally, we report different correlation patterns with inflammatory markers depending on the type of inflammatory response (chronic or acute trauma). Our results illustrate the breadth of the physiological relevance of SCFAs on human inflammatory and metabolic responses highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of this important class of molecules.
